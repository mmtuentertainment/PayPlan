# Feature Specification: User Preference Management System

**Feature Branch**: `012-user-preference-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a user preference management system for PayPlan that allows users to save their personalized settings across sessions. When a user configures their preferences (timezone, payday dates, business day settings, currency format, and locale), the system should store these choices locally in their browser. On subsequent visits, the application should automatically restore their saved preferences without requiring re-entry. Users should be able to explicitly reset all preferences to defaults with a single action. The system must maintain privacy-first principles (no server storage, local-only), support explicit opt-in/opt-out for each preference category, and provide clear visual feedback when preferences are loaded or reset."

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: Where and when should users control opt-in/opt-out for each preference category? → A: Combination: inline toggles next to each preference control + centralized settings screen for review/bulk changes (following industry best practices for discoverability, control, and GDPR compliance)
- Q: How should the system store multiple payday dates (e.g., "1st and 15th", "every Friday", "5th, 15th, and 25th")? → A: Flexible format supporting both specific dates (1-31) and recurring patterns (e.g., "every Friday", "biweekly"), following payroll industry standards (ADP, Gusto) to accommodate salaried, hourly, and contractor pay schedules
- Q: What is the acceptable maximum time for preference restoration during application initialization? → A: <100ms (imperceptible, no loading indicator needed) - following Google RAIL model and Nielsen Norman Group research confirming <100ms feels instantaneous to users
- Q: What type of visual feedback should be shown when preferences are saved/restored/reset? → A: Combination: toast notifications (2-3 sec auto-dismiss) for user-initiated saves/resets + persistent inline indicators for system-initiated restoration, following Material Design/Apple HIG patterns and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable size for stored preference data per user? → A: <5KB total (sufficient for all text-based preferences, ensures fast read/write operations, well within localStorage quota to prevent quotaExceededError)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Sarah is a freelance consultant who uses PayPlan weekly to plan her BNPL payments around her irregular income schedule. She's frustrated that every time she visits the application, she has to reconfigure her timezone (PST), set her payday dates (1st and 15th), configure business day rules, and set her preferred currency format (USD with commas). She wants PayPlan to remember her settings so she can immediately start importing payment schedules without repetitive configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a first-time user visits PayPlan and configures their timezone to "America/New_York", **When** they return to the application in a new browser session, **Then** the system should automatically restore their timezone preference to "America/New_York" without requiring re-entry.

2. **Given** a user has saved payday dates (5th and 20th) and business day settings, **When** they explicitly click the "Reset All Preferences" button, **Then** all preferences should revert to application defaults and the user should see clear visual confirmation of the reset action.

3. **Given** a user has opted out of saving timezone preferences but opted in for currency format, **When** they return in a new session, **Then** only their currency format preference should be restored while timezone should revert to the default.

4. **Given** a user configures their locale to "en-GB" with GBP currency, **When** they close their browser and return the next day, **Then** the system should restore both locale and currency preferences seamlessly during application initialization.

5. **Given** a user is configuring their preferences for the first time, **When** the system successfully saves a preference category, **Then** the user should see immediate visual feedback (success indicator) confirming the preference was saved.

6. **Given** a user has multiple preference categories configured, **When** they choose to opt out of saving a specific category (e.g., timezone), **Then** only that category should be excluded from automatic restoration while other opted-in preferences continue to be saved and restored.

7. **Given** a user is configuring a preference (e.g., timezone), **When** they see the inline opt-in toggle next to the preference control, **Then** they should be able to immediately control whether that specific preference is saved, and they should also be able to access a centralized settings screen to review and bulk-manage all opt-in/opt-out choices.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's saved timezone preference becomes invalid due to timezone database updates?
  - System should detect invalid preferences during restoration and fall back to application defaults with a notification to the user.

- How does the system handle preference data corruption in browser storage?
  - System should detect corrupted data, log the error for diagnostics, restore application defaults, and notify the user that preferences were reset.

- What happens when a user accesses PayPlan from multiple devices or browsers?
  - Each browser maintains its own preference set (local-only storage). Users must configure preferences separately per device, consistent with the privacy-first, no-server-storage constraint.

- How does the system handle users who have disabled browser storage permissions?
  - System should gracefully degrade: preferences work during the current session but don't persist. A non-intrusive notification informs the user that preference persistence requires browser storage permissions.

- What happens when preference categories are added or removed in future application versions?
  - System should handle unknown preference keys gracefully (ignore obsolete keys, use defaults for new keys not yet saved).

- How does the system validate payday date patterns (e.g., "31st" in February, invalid recurring patterns)?
  - System should validate payday configurations when saved and flag impossible dates (e.g., Feb 31st) with clear error messages. For recurring patterns, validate pattern syntax and ensure compatibility with calendar rules.

- What happens if preference data exceeds the 5KB storage limit?
  - System should validate total storage size before saving, reject saves that exceed 5KB, and display a clear error message advising users to simplify their configurations (e.g., reduce number of payday dates). This prevents quotaExceededError and ensures reliable storage operations.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically save user preferences to browser-local storage immediately when users configure any of the following categories: timezone, payday dates, business day settings, currency format, and locale.

- **FR-002**: System MUST restore saved preferences automatically during application initialization on subsequent visits, without requiring user action or re-entry.

- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to opt in or opt out of automatic preference saving for each preference category independently through inline toggles displayed next to each preference control, with all opt-in/opt-out choices also accessible in a centralized settings screen for review and bulk management.

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a single-action "Reset All Preferences" control that reverts all preference categories to application defaults.

- **FR-005**: System MUST display a toast notification (2-3 second auto-dismiss) when preferences are successfully saved, with ARIA live region announcement for screen reader accessibility.

- **FR-006**: System MUST display persistent inline status indicators next to preference controls when saved preferences are successfully restored during application initialization.

- **FR-007**: System MUST display a toast notification (2-3 second auto-dismiss) when all preferences are reset to defaults, with ARIA live region announcement for screen reader accessibility.

- **FR-008**: System MUST store all preference data exclusively in browser-local storage with no server transmission or storage (privacy-first constraint).

- **FR-009**: System MUST validate restored preferences during initialization and fall back to application defaults for any invalid or corrupted data.

- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle scenarios where browser storage is unavailable (permissions disabled), allowing preferences to work for the current session without persistence.

- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce a maximum storage size of 5KB for all preference data combined, rejecting preference saves that exceed this limit with clear error messages to the user.

- **FR-011**: System MUST distinguish between user-configured preferences and application defaults, ensuring users can differentiate between a preference they explicitly set versus system defaults.

- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain preference persistence across browser sessions, browser restarts, and page refreshes.

- **FR-013**: System MUST support independent management of five preference categories: timezone, payday dates, business day settings, currency format, and locale.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST restore saved preferences from browser storage within 100 milliseconds during application initialization to provide an imperceptible, instantaneous user experience (no loading indicator required).

- **NFR-002**: Preference restoration MUST complete before the application renders user-facing controls, ensuring users never see default values that are immediately replaced by saved preferences.

- **NFR-003**: All visual feedback mechanisms (toast notifications, inline indicators) MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, including ARIA live region announcements for screen readers and keyboard-accessible dismissal controls.

### Key Entities

- **User Preference**: Represents a user's saved configuration choice for a specific category (e.g., timezone, currency format). Each preference includes:
  - Preference category (timezone, payday dates, business day settings, currency format, locale)
  - Preference value (the actual user choice, e.g., "America/Los_Angeles", "USD")
  - Opt-in status (whether user has consented to saving this category)
  - Timestamp (when the preference was last saved, for diagnostics and version management)

- **Preference Category**: Represents a distinct group of related settings that users can configure:
  - Timezone (user's geographical timezone for date/time calculations)
  - Payday Dates (flexible income schedule supporting both specific dates like "1st, 15th" and recurring patterns like "every Friday" or "biweekly", accommodating salaried, hourly, and contractor pay schedules)
  - Business Day Settings (rules for determining working days vs. weekends/holidays)
  - Currency Format (display formatting for monetary amounts, including symbol and separators)
  - Locale (language/region setting affecting date formats, number formats, and UI text)

- **Application Default**: Represents the system's fallback value for each preference category when no user preference exists or when preferences are reset. Examples:
  - Default timezone: browser's detected timezone or UTC
  - Default payday dates: none/empty (user must configure)
  - Default business day settings: Monday-Friday, no holidays
  - Default currency format: USD with standard US formatting
  - Default locale: en-US

## Business Value & Context

### Why This Feature Now
This feature addresses a critical friction point for repeat users. Based on the current feature progression:
-  Core CSV/email import functionality (Features 001-007)
-  Risk detection and date handling (Features 008-009)
-  Telemetry consent with auto-dismiss UX (Features 008-0020-3, 011-009-008-0020)
- **� User preference persistence (this feature)**

The progression shows increasing sophistication in user experience. Users now have robust import and analysis capabilities, but they experience repetitive configuration friction on each visit. This feature removes that friction while maintaining PayPlan's core privacy-first principle (no authentication, no server-side storage).

### User Impact
- **Power users** can streamline their workflow, reducing session setup time from ~2 minutes to ~5 seconds
- **Repeat users** experience consistent, personalized settings without cognitive overhead
- **Privacy-conscious users** benefit from transparent, local-only storage with granular opt-in controls
- **Multi-device users** maintain independence (each device can have its own preference profile)

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in configuration interactions per session (target: 80% reduction for repeat users)
- Preference restoration success rate (target: 99%+, accounting for edge cases)
- User opt-in rate for preference categories (measure user trust in privacy-first approach)
- Reduction in user-reported friction about repetitive configuration
