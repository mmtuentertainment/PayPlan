## 1. localStorage Best Practices (2025)

**Decision**: Use browser localStorage API with comprehensive error handling and quota validation.

**Rationale**:
- localStorage provides persistent, origin-specific storage that survives browser sessions
- Native browser API requires no external dependencies
- Synchronous API enables <100ms read operations for instant preference restoration
- UTF-16 string storage is sufficient for text-based preferences (timezone IDs, date patterns, locale codes)
- Well-supported across all modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **IndexedDB**: More complex API, async operations would not meet <100ms target. Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for small text data.
- **sessionStorage**: Does not persist across browser restarts. Rejected because feature requires multi-session persistence.
- **Cookies**: 4KB limit, sent with every HTTP request (privacy concern). Rejected for privacy and size limitations.
- **Cache API**: Designed for HTTP responses, not key-value storage. Rejected as inappropriate for preference data.

**Sources**:
- MDN Web Docs - Window.localStorage (2025): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
- Researched: 2025-10-13

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Storage Format**: JSON.stringify() for serialization, JSON.parse() for deserialization
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap localStorage operations in try/catch blocks
  - `SecurityError`: Can occur when cookies are blocked or in private browsing mode
  - `QuotaExceededError`: Handle by rejecting save and displaying error message (FR-014: 5KB limit)
- **Privacy Context**: localStorage is blocked when users disable cookies in some browsers (e.g., Safari)
- **Quota**: Typical localStorage limit is 5-10MB per origin; our 5KB limit is well within safe range
- **Performance**: localStorage.getItem() is synchronous and typically completes in 1-10ms (well under 100ms target)
- **Cross-tab Synchronization**: Listen for `storage` event on window to detect changes in other tabs

```javascript
// Recommended pattern from research
try {
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {
    // Handle quota exceeded
  } else if (error.name === 'SecurityError') {
    // Handle privacy restrictions
  }
}
```

## 2. React 19 State Management Patterns

**Decision**: Use `useSyncExternalStore` for localStorage synchronization with custom hooks pattern.

**Rationale**:
- React 19's `useSyncExternalStore` is designed specifically for external store synchronization (like localStorage)
- Provides built-in support for cross-tab synchronization via `storage` events
- Prevents race conditions and ensures consistency across component re-renders
- Compatible with React's concurrent rendering features
- Follows React's recommended architecture for external state

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **useState + useEffect**: Simple but prone to race conditions with cross-tab updates. Rejected for reliability concerns.
- **useReducer + useEffect**: Better for complex state logic but doesn't solve cross-tab sync. Rejected for lacking built-in external store support.
- **Third-party libraries** (Zustand, Jotai): Add unnecessary dependencies. Rejected to minimize bundle size and maintain simplicity.
- **React Context only**: Doesn't persist across sessions. Rejected for not meeting persistence requirement.

**Sources**:
- React.dev - Hooks Reference (2025): https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks
- Researched: 2025-10-13

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: `usePreferences()` wraps `useSyncExternalStore`
- **Lazy Initialization**: Use lazy initialization in `useState` to read from localStorage only once on mount
- **Memoization**: Use `useCallback` for state update functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Storage Event Handling**: Subscribe to `storage` event in `useSyncExternalStore` subscribe function
- **Performance**: `useMemo` for expensive calculations (e.g., payday date pattern parsing)

```javascript
// Recommended pattern from research
function useLocalStorageState(key, initialValue) {
  const subscribe = useCallback((onStoreChange) => {
    const handleStorageChange = (e) => {
      if (e.key === key) onStoreChange();
    };
    window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
  }, [key]);

  const getSnapshot = useCallback(() => {
    try {
      const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
      return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : initialValue;
    } catch {
      return initialValue;
    }
  }, [key, initialValue]);

  return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
}
```

## 3. Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Decision**: Implement ARIA live regions for toast notifications, full keyboard accessibility, and semantic HTML with ARIA attributes.

**Rationale**:
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA is industry standard for web accessibility compliance (specified in NFR-003)
- ARIA live regions ensure screen readers announce toast notifications without requiring focus
- Keyboard accessibility (Success Criterion 2.1.1) is non-negotiable for accessible preference controls
- Semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes ensures assistive technology compatibility
- Meets legal accessibility requirements in many jurisdictions (ADA, Section 508, European Accessibility Act)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Visual-only feedback**: Fails accessibility requirements. Rejected for excluding screen reader users.
- **Alert dialogs for all feedback**: Blocks user workflow, excessive for simple confirmations. Rejected for poor UX.
- **Focus-based announcements only**: Misses off-screen updates. Rejected for incomplete coverage.
- **WCAG 2.0 Level A only**: Insufficient for modern accessibility standards. Rejected for not meeting spec requirement (NFR-003).

**Sources**:
- W3C WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference (2025): https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/
- Researched: 2025-10-13

**Implementation Notes**:
- **ARIA Live Regions**: Use `aria-live="polite"` for toast notifications (non-intrusive announcements)
- **Toast Notification Attributes**:
  - `role="status"` for success messages
  - `role="alert"` for error messages (more assertive)
  - `aria-atomic="true"` to announce entire message
- **Keyboard Accessibility**:
  - All controls must be focusable (tabIndex={0} for custom elements)
  - Toast dismiss button must be keyboard-accessible (Enter/Space keys)
  - Escape key to dismiss toast notifications
  - Settings screen must support Tab navigation
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**:
  - Inline toggles: `<input type="checkbox" aria-label="Save timezone preference">`
  - Status indicators: `aria-label="Timezone preference restored from previous session"`
  - Settings screen: Proper heading hierarchy (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) for navigation landmarks
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text (Success Criterion 1.4.3)

```jsx
// Recommended pattern from research
<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  {/* Toast notification content */}
  <button aria-label="Dismiss notification" onClick={handleDismiss}>
    Ã—
  </button>
</div>
```

## 4. Flexible Date Pattern Storage

**Decision**: Support both specific date patterns (day-of-month arrays) and recurring patterns (weekly/biweekly enums) with JSON serialization.

**Rationale**:
- Real-world payroll schedules use diverse patterns: 45.7% biweekly, 31.8% weekly, 18% semi-monthly, 4.4% monthly
- Specific dates (e.g., "1st and 15th") accommodate salaried employees (semi-monthly pattern)
- Recurring patterns (e.g., "every Friday", "biweekly") accommodate hourly/weekly employees
- Flexible design supports gig economy workers with multiple income streams
- JSON serialization keeps data within 5KB limit while maintaining readability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Fixed two-date model**: Excludes weekly and monthly patterns. Rejected for insufficient coverage (only 18% of users).
- **Day-of-month only**: Cannot represent "every Friday" patterns. Rejected for excluding 31.8% weekly payrolls.
- **Cron expressions**: Overly complex for user-facing feature. Rejected for poor UX and unnecessary flexibility.
- **ISO 8601 recurrence rules**: Standard but verbose. Rejected for storage overhead and parsing complexity.

**Sources**:
- Wikipedia - Payroll (2025): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll
- Researched: 2025-10-13

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Data Structure**:
  ```typescript
  type PaydayPattern =
    | { type: 'specific', dates: number[] } // e.g., [1, 15] for semi-monthly
    | { type: 'weekly', dayOfWeek: 0-6 }    // e.g., 5 for Friday
    | { type: 'biweekly', startDate: string, dayOfWeek: 0-6 }
    | { type: 'monthly', dayOfMonth: number };
  ```
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Specific dates: Must be 1-31, check for month validity (e.g., reject 31 for February)
  - Weekly: dayOfWeek must be 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)
  - Biweekly: startDate must be valid ISO date, dayOfWeek 0-6
  - Monthly: dayOfMonth 1-31 (handle month-end overflow with luxon library)
- **Luxon Integration**: Use existing luxon 3.7 dependency for date validation and month-end handling
- **Storage Size**: JSON representation ~50-150 bytes per pattern (well within 5KB total limit)
- **Common Patterns**:
  - Semi-monthly: `{ type: 'specific', dates: [1, 15] }` (18% of payrolls)
  - Biweekly Friday: `{ type: 'biweekly', startDate: '2025-10-10', dayOfWeek: 5 }` (45.7% of payrolls)
  - Weekly Friday: `{ type: 'weekly', dayOfWeek: 5 }` (31.8% of payrolls)
  - Monthly 1st: `{ type: 'monthly', dayOfMonth: 1 }` (4.4% of payrolls)

## 5. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement synchronous localStorage reads at app initialization (target <100ms) with debounced writes (300ms delay) for save operations.

**Rationale**:
- Google's RAIL model (2025) recommends <100ms for instant feedback, <200ms for INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- localStorage.getItem() is synchronous and typically 1-10ms (meets <100ms target with 10x safety margin)
- Debouncing writes prevents excessive localStorage operations during rapid user input
- Lazy initialization ensures preferences load before first render (NFR-002: no default value flash)
- localStorage write performance (~5-20ms) is acceptable with debouncing to batch updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Async localStorage wrapper**: Unnecessary complexity, doesn't improve performance. Rejected for adding latency.
- **No debouncing**: Could cause excessive writes with rapid toggling. Rejected for potential performance impact.
- **IndexedDB for async reads**: Async API would violate <100ms target. Rejected for performance regression.
- **In-memory cache only**: Wouldn't persist preferences. Rejected for not meeting persistence requirement.

**Sources**:
- web.dev - Core Web Vitals (2025): https://web.dev/articles/vitals
- Researched: 2025-10-13

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Read Performance**:
  - Use lazy initialization pattern: `useState(() => localStorage.getItem(key))`
  - Load preferences before React tree render (in `<App>` component initialization)
  - Measure with Performance API: `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()`
- **Write Performance**:
  - Debounce writes with 300ms delay (balance between responsiveness and efficiency)
  - Use `lodash.debounce` or custom debounce implementation
  - Flush pending writes before page unload (`beforeunload` event)
- **INP Optimization**:
  - Target <200ms for Interaction to Next Paint (Core Web Vital for 2025)
  - Preference toggle interactions must feel instant (<100ms perceived latency)
  - Measure at 75th percentile of page loads
- **Web Vitals Monitoring**:
  - Use `web-vitals` library for tracking (already available in modern browsers)
  - Monitor INP, LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
  - Log performance metrics to console in development for debugging
- **Lazy Loading**: Don't load preference UI components until settings screen is accessed (code-splitting with React.lazy)

```javascript
// Recommended debounce pattern from research
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const debouncedSave = debounce((key, value) => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}, 300);

// Flush on page unload
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  debouncedSave.flush();
});
```
