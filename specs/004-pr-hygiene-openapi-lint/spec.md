# Feature Specification: PR Hygiene + OpenAPI Lint Guard

**Feature Branch**: `004-pr-hygiene-openapi-lint`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "raise PR quality + keep 'OpenAPI is source of truth' without touching runtime. Smallest reversible slice: add a PR template + a non-blocking OpenAPI lint in CI that only runs if an OpenAPI file exists. Constraints: ‚â§8 files, ‚â§180 LOC, 2 domains (PR hygiene, API spec lint). Why this now: immediate reviewer signal, zero blast radius, complements 0013/0014 guards."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Goal: Improve PR quality + enforce OpenAPI as source of truth
   ‚Üí Constraints: ‚â§8 files, ‚â§180 LOC, docs/CI only (zero runtime impact)
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Actors: PR reviewers, PR authors, CI system
   ‚Üí Actions: template rendering, spec detection, linting, summary generation
   ‚Üí Data: PR metadata, OpenAPI spec files, lint results
   ‚Üí Constraints: non-blocking, reversible, minimal LOC
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Scenario 1: PR opened without spec (template renders, lint skips)
   ‚Üí Scenario 2: PR opened with valid spec (template renders, lint passes)
   ‚Üí Scenario 3: PR opened with invalid spec (template renders, lint fails with helpful summary)
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí 12 functional requirements covering template, detection, linting, reporting
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí PR Template, OpenAPI Spec, Lint Results, CI Job Summary
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec
   ‚Üí All requirements testable
   ‚Üí Success criteria measurable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **PR reviewer**, I want **structured PR descriptions with security checklists and automatic OpenAPI validation** so that I can **quickly assess risk, verify API changes match the spec, and ensure consistent PR quality across the team**.

As a **PR author**, I want **a clear template and immediate feedback on OpenAPI spec issues** so that I can **submit well-documented PRs with valid API specs without manual validation**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer opens a new PR in a repository without an OpenAPI spec, **When** the PR is created, **Then** the PR description is pre-filled with a template (Summary, Risk, Rollback, Verification, LOC table, Security checklist) and the CI job reports "Skipped (no openapi.yaml found)"

2. **Given** a developer opens a PR in a repository with a valid OpenAPI spec at `openapi.yaml`, **When** the PR is created, **Then** the PR template renders AND the CI job detects the spec, runs Spectral lint, and reports "‚úÖ No Spectral issues detected" in the job summary

3. **Given** a developer opens a PR that modifies an OpenAPI spec with validation errors, **When** the PR is created, **Then** the CI job detects the spec, runs Spectral lint, finds issues, and posts an RFC9457-style Problem Details JSON excerpt showing the first 25 issues in the GitHub Actions Summary

4. **Given** a developer wants to check which OpenAPI spec will be linted, **When** they run `npm run spec:path` locally, **Then** the command prints "OpenAPI spec: [path]" or "No OpenAPI spec found; skipping"

5. **Given** a PR author fills out the security checklist in the template, **When** reviewers examine the PR, **Then** they can quickly verify that Idempotency-Key, RFC9457, RBAC, rate limiting, tenant RLS, and OpenAPI updates are addressed (if endpoints changed)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when **multiple OpenAPI spec files exist** (e.g., both `openapi.yaml` and `api/openapi.yaml`)? ‚Üí CI detects the first match in priority order and lints only that file
- How does the system handle **malformed OpenAPI spec files** that crash the linter? ‚Üí Spectral outputs errors to JSON, summary shows the error, job continues (non-blocking)
- What if **the spec is valid but uses deprecated features**? ‚Üí Spectral flags warnings in the summary; job still passes (non-blocking)
- What happens when **developers don't fill out the PR template**? ‚Üí Template still renders; reviewers can request completion; no automated enforcement (human process)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a PR template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` that automatically populates the PR description field when a PR is created

- **FR-002**: PR template MUST include the following sections: Title, Summary, Risk (checkboxes: None/Low/Medium/High), Rollback, Verification (with code block), LOC Budget table, Security checklist (6 items), and Notes

- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a CI workflow that runs on all pull request events

- **FR-004**: CI workflow MUST detect OpenAPI spec files in the following priority order: `openapi.yaml`, `openapi.yml`, `api/openapi.yaml`, `api/openapi.yml`

- **FR-005**: CI workflow MUST skip OpenAPI linting if no spec file is detected and report "Skipped (no openapi.yaml found)" in the job summary

- **FR-006**: CI workflow MUST lint detected OpenAPI specs using Spectral CLI when a spec file exists

- **FR-007**: CI workflow MUST be non-blocking (use `continue-on-error: true`) so that PRs are not blocked by lint failures

- **FR-008**: CI workflow MUST output lint results in JSON format for programmatic processing

- **FR-009**: CI workflow MUST post an RFC9457-style Problem Details summary to GitHub Actions Summary (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`) showing up to 25 lint issues

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a local helper script `npm run spec:path` that prints the detected OpenAPI spec path or "No OpenAPI spec found; skipping"

- **FR-011**: System MUST document all changes in a delta file at `ops/deltas/0015_pr_hygiene_openapi.md` including scope, verification steps, and rollback instructions

- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain zero runtime code changes (docs/CI only) and stay within ‚â§180 LOC budget

### Key Entities

- **PR Template**: Structured markdown file that GitHub automatically loads into the PR description field; contains sections for Summary, Risk, Rollback, Verification, LOC Budget table, Security checklist (Idempotency-Key, RFC9457, RBAC+audit, 429+Retry-After, Tenant RLS via BFF, OpenAPI SoT), and Notes

- **OpenAPI Spec**: YAML file describing the API contract; located at one of four possible paths (root or `api/` directory, `.yaml` or `.yml` extension); serves as the source of truth for API endpoints

- **Lint Results**: JSON output from Spectral CLI containing issues found in the OpenAPI spec; includes rule IDs, severity, messages, and line numbers; limited to first 25 issues in the summary

- **CI Job Summary**: GitHub Actions feature (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`) that displays formatted output in the job's summary view; shows RFC9457-style Problem Details with detected issues or success/skip messages

- **Delta Document**: Markdown file documenting the change (Delta 0015); includes type (tooling-only), runtime impact (none), rollback (single revert), changes made, and verification steps

---

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted (PR quality, OpenAPI SoT, CI linting, templates)
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none - description is complete)
- [x] User scenarios defined (5 scenarios + 4 edge cases)

---

## Additional Context

### Relationship to Existing Deltas
- **Delta 0013**: Docs-only realignment (provides context for maintaining spec accuracy)
- **Delta 0014**: CI guards (ESLint, performance, spec audit) - this adds another complementary guard

### Success Metrics
- PR template adoption: 100% (automatic)
- OpenAPI spec detection accuracy: 100% (if spec exists in defined locations)
- CI job non-blocking: 100% (continues on error)
- LOC budget adherence: ‚â§180 LOC
- File count: ‚â§8 files
- Runtime impact: 0 changes

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Make OpenAPI lint blocking after spec stabilizes (change `continue-on-error` to `false`)
- Add custom Spectral rulesets for project-specific API standards
- Integrate with PR comment bot to post lint results inline
- Support additional spec formats (Swagger 2.0, AsyncAPI)
