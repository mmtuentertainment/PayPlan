## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story: API Consumer
A developer integrates PayPlan's `/api/plan` endpoint into their application. When errors occur (invalid input, rate limits), they receive standardized RFC 9457 Problem Details responses with machine-readable error types and human-readable descriptions. When they retry requests, they can use Idempotency-Key headers to safely retry without creating duplicate work. When they exceed rate limits, they receive clear 429 responses with Retry-After headers telling them exactly when to retry.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer sends an invalid request (missing required field), **When** the API responds, **Then** they receive:
   - HTTP 400 status
   - Content-Type: application/problem+json
   - Response body with: type (URI), title, status (400), detail (specific error), instance (request ID)
   - Linkable type URI (e.g., /problems/validation-error) with human-readable explanation

2. **Given** a developer exceeds the rate limit (60 req/hour), **When** they send request #61, **Then** they receive:
   - HTTP 429 status
   - Content-Type: application/problem+json
   - Retry-After header (seconds until reset)
   - X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset headers
   - Problem Details body explaining rate limit exceeded

3. **Given** a developer sends a request with an Idempotency-Key header, **When** they retry the exact same request within 60 seconds, **Then** they receive:
   - HTTP 200 with the cached response (not reprocessed)
   - X-Idempotent-Replayed: true header
   - Same plan data as original request

4. **Given** a developer sends a request with an Idempotency-Key that was used with different body data, **When** the API processes it, **Then** they receive:
   - HTTP 409 status
   - Content-Type: application/problem+json
   - Problem Details explaining idempotency key conflict
   - Suggestion to use a new key or wait for TTL expiration

5. **Given** a successful request, **When** the API responds with 200 OK, **Then** the response:
   - Keeps existing JSON format (backward compatible)
   - Includes X-RateLimit-* headers showing remaining quota
   - Does NOT use problem+json (only for errors)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when rate limit resets mid-second?
- How are idempotency keys cleaned up after 60s TTL?
- What if two requests arrive simultaneously with same Idempotency-Key?
- How is rate limiting handled across Vercel's distributed edge network?
- What happens if idempotency storage fails?
- How are problem type URIs versioned?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**A) RFC 9457 Problem Details (Error Responses)**

- **FR-001**: All 4xx and 5xx error responses MUST use Content-Type `application/problem+json`
- **FR-002**: Problem Details responses MUST include required fields:
  - `type` (string, URI): Link to human-readable problem explanation
  - `title` (string): Short, human-readable summary
  - `status` (number): HTTP status code
  - `detail` (string): Specific explanation for this occurrence
  - `instance` (string, optional): URI reference to specific occurrence
- **FR-003**: System MUST define problem types for:
  - `validation-error` (400): Invalid request body or missing required fields
  - `method-not-allowed` (405): Non-POST request to /api/plan
  - `unsupported-media-type` (415): Non-JSON content-type
  - `unprocessable-entity` (422): Valid JSON but semantic errors
  - `rate-limit-exceeded` (429): Too many requests from IP
  - `idempotency-key-conflict` (409): Same key, different body
  - `internal-error` (500): Server processing failure
- **FR-004**: Each problem type MUST have a corresponding documentation page at `/problems/{type-name}`
- **FR-005**: Problem type URIs MUST be absolute (e.g., `https://frontend-[...].vercel.app/problems/validation-error`)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for 200 OK responses (existing JSON format)
- **FR-007**: Problem Details MUST be machine-readable (parseable JSON with consistent schema)

**B) Rate Limiting (Serverless-Friendly)**

- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce rate limit of 60 requests per hour per IP address for POST /api/plan
- **FR-009**: Rate limit counter MUST be configurable via environment variable `RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` (default: 60)
- **FR-010**: System MUST return HTTP 429 when rate limit exceeded
- **FR-011**: 429 responses MUST include `Retry-After` header (seconds until limit resets)
- **FR-012**: All responses (success and error) MUST include rate limit headers:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per hour
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets
- **FR-013**: Rate limit implementation MUST work in Vercel's serverless/edge environment (no persistent state between function invocations)
- **FR-014**: System MUST use IP address from `x-forwarded-for` or `x-real-ip` headers (Vercel proxy)
- **FR-015**: Rate limit storage MUST have minimal overhead (<50ms lookup/update)

**C) Idempotency-Key Support**

- **FR-016**: System MUST accept optional `Idempotency-Key` header on POST /api/plan
- **FR-017**: Idempotency-Key MUST be a string (recommended: UUID v4, min 16 chars, max 255 chars)
- **FR-018**: When Idempotency-Key is provided, system MUST:
  - Hash the request body (deterministic)
  - Check cache for existing response with same key
  - If found with same body hash: return cached response with `X-Idempotent-Replayed: true`
  - If found with different body hash: return 409 problem+json
  - If not found: process request, cache response for 60 seconds
- **FR-019**: Idempotency cache TTL MUST be 60 seconds (configurable via `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS`)
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle concurrent requests with same Idempotency-Key (first wins, others wait or get cached response)
- **FR-021**: Idempotency implementation MUST work in Vercel's stateless environment
- **FR-022**: System MUST NOT require external databases for idempotency (use Vercel KV, memory, or similar)

**Error Documentation Pages**

- **FR-023**: System MUST serve static documentation pages at `/problems/*` for each problem type
- **FR-024**: Each problem page MUST include:
  - Problem type name and HTTP status code
  - Description of when this error occurs
  - Common causes
  - How to fix it
  - Example problem+json response
- **FR-025**: Problem pages MUST be accessible without authentication
- **FR-026**: Problem pages MUST link back to main API documentation

**Backward Compatibility**

- **FR-027**: System MUST NOT change the 200 OK response format (existing JSON structure)
- **FR-028**: System MUST NOT break existing API consumers who don't send Idempotency-Key
- **FR-029**: Frontend application MUST continue to work without changes (errors already handled)
- **FR-030**: Rate limits MUST be generous enough for normal usage (60/hour allows 1 request per minute)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- **NFR-001**: Rate limit check MUST add <50ms to request latency
- **NFR-002**: Idempotency lookup MUST add <100ms to request latency
- **NFR-003**: Problem Details serialization MUST add <10ms to error responses

**Reliability**
- **NFR-004**: Rate limit failures MUST NOT block requests (fail open)
- **NFR-005**: Idempotency cache failures MUST NOT block requests (process normally)

**Observability**
- **NFR-006**: Rate limit hits MUST be logged with IP, timestamp, remaining quota
- **NFR-007**: Idempotency cache hits MUST be logged with key, replayed status

## Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metric**: A developer can send invalid requests and receive standardized RFC 9457 Problem Details responses with helpful error messages and linkable documentation.

**Additional Success Indicators**:
- curl test with invalid body returns `application/problem+json` with type URI
- curl test exceeding 60 req/hour returns 429 with Retry-After header
- curl test with Idempotency-Key returns cached response on retry (X-Idempotent-Replayed: true)
- curl test with same key but different body returns 409 conflict
- All problem type URIs (`/problems/*`) are accessible and human-readable
- Existing frontend application works without modification
- Rate limit headers present on all responses

**Out of Scope for v0.1.1**:
- Authentication or API keys
- Per-user rate limits (IP-based only)
- Persistent storage or databases
- Distributed rate limiting across regions
- Advanced caching strategies (Redis, etc.)
- Analytics or metrics dashboards
- Custom rate limit tiers
- Webhook notifications
- IP whitelist/blacklist

## Clarifications Needed

### Session 1: 2025-09-30

**Q1: Rate Limit Storage** - How should rate limit state be stored in Vercel's serverless environment?

**Options:**
- A) Vercel KV (requires paid plan, persistent)
- B) Upstash Redis (free tier, works with Vercel)
- C) In-memory Map with periodic cleanup (works only within single function instance)
- D) Accept stateless limitation (each cold start resets counters)

**Recommendation:** B (Upstash Redis free tier) or D (stateless, simpler for v0.1.1)

**Q2: Idempotency Storage** - Same question for idempotency cache?

**Options:**
- A) Vercel KV
- B) Upstash Redis with 60s TTL
- C) In-memory Map (limited to single instance)
- D) Skip idempotency for v0.1.1, add in v0.2

**Recommendation:** B (Upstash Redis) or D (defer to v0.2)

**Q3: Problem Type URI Domain** - Should problem type URIs use the production domain or a stable generic domain?

**Options:**
- A) Use production Vercel URL (e.g., `https://frontend-ku48gid48.vercel.app/problems/...`)
- B) Use relative URIs (`/problems/validation-error`)
- C) Use generic placeholder (`https://payplan.example.com/problems/...`)

**Recommendation:** B (relative URIs) for flexibility across deployments

**Q4: Rate Limit Window** - Should the 60 req/hour be a sliding window or fixed window?

**Options:**
- A) Fixed window (resets every hour on the hour)
- B) Sliding window (rolling 60-minute period)
- C) Token bucket (smoother distribution)

**Recommendation:** A (fixed window) for simplicity in serverless

**Q5: Existing Frontend** - Should the frontend be updated to display Problem Details, or keep current error handling?

**Options:**
- A) Update frontend to parse and display problem+json fields
- B) Keep current error handling (works with both formats)
- C) Add optional enhanced display if problem+json detected

**Recommendation:** B (no changes needed, backward compatible)
