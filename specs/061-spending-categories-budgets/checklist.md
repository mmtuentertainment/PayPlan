## Functional Requirements (from spec.md)

### User Story 1: Create and Manage Categories
- [ ] FR1.1: Users can create custom categories with name, icon, and color
- [ ] FR1.2: Category names must be unique (case-insensitive)
- [ ] FR1.3: Users can edit category name, icon, and color
- [ ] FR1.4: Users can delete custom categories
- [ ] FR1.5: Deleting a category with transactions requires confirmation
- [ ] FR1.6: Deleting a category uncategorizes its transactions (sets categoryId to null)
- [ ] FR1.7: Maximum 100 categories per user (soft limit)

### User Story 2: Set Monthly Budgets
- [ ] FR2.1: Users can set a monthly spending limit for any category
- [ ] FR2.2: Budget amount must be greater than $0
- [ ] FR2.3: One budget per category (1:1 relationship)
- [ ] FR2.4: Users can edit budget amount
- [ ] FR2.5: Users can delete budgets
- [ ] FR2.6: Deleting a category automatically deletes its budget

### User Story 3: Track Budget Progress
- [ ] FR3.1: Users see visual progress bars for each budget
- [ ] FR3.2: Progress bar shows: spent amount, remaining amount, percentage
- [ ] FR3.3: Progress bar color changes based on status (safe, warning, danger)
- [ ] FR3.4: Progress calculated from current month's transactions only
- [ ] FR3.5: Progress updates automatically when transactions are added/edited/deleted

### User Story 4: Assign Transactions to Categories
- [ ] FR4.1: Users can assign transactions to categories via dropdown
- [ ] FR4.2: Transactions can be uncategorized (categoryId = null)
- [ ] FR4.3: Category dropdown shows all categories (pre-defined + custom)
- [ ] FR4.4: Assigning a transaction to a category updates budget progress immediately

### User Story 5: Use Pre-defined Categories
- [ ] FR5.1: New users see 9 pre-defined categories on first load
- [ ] FR5.2: Pre-defined categories include: Groceries, Dining, Transportation, Housing, Utilities, Entertainment, Healthcare, Debt, Savings
- [ ] FR5.3: Each pre-defined category has appropriate icon and color
- [ ] FR5.4: Pre-defined categories cannot be deleted (only hidden in future)

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All forms navigable with Tab/Shift+Tab
- [ ] All buttons activatable with Enter/Space
- [ ] Dropdowns navigable with Arrow keys
- [ ] Dialogs closable with Escape
- [ ] Focus visible on all interactive elements

### Screen Readers
- [ ] All form fields have proper labels
- [ ] All buttons have descriptive text
- [ ] Progress bars have role="progressbar"
- [ ] Progress bars have aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax
- [ ] Error messages announced to screen readers
- [ ] Success messages announced to screen readers

### Visual Accessibility
- [ ] Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Chart/progress bar contrast ratio ≥ 3:1 (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Progress bars use icons + text (not color alone)
- [ ] Status indicators use dual encodings (color + icon/text)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and high-contrast

### Testing
- [ ] Manual keyboard navigation test passed
- [ ] Manual screen reader test passed (NVDA or VoiceOver)
- [ ] Manual color contrast test passed (axe DevTools)
- [ ] Manual reduced motion test passed

## Performance

### Load Times
- [ ] Category list renders in <500ms with 100+ categories
- [ ] Budget list renders in <500ms with 100+ budgets
- [ ] Dashboard loads in <1s (constitution requirement)

### Interactions
- [ ] Category creation completes in <30s (constitution requirement)
- [ ] Budget creation completes in <15s (constitution requirement)
- [ ] Budget progress updates in <500ms after transaction change
- [ ] localStorage writes debounced to 500ms

### Optimization
- [ ] CategoryCard uses React.memo
- [ ] BudgetCard uses React.memo
- [ ] Expensive calculations memoized (useMemo)
- [ ] localStorage reads cached in React state

### Testing
- [ ] Performance test: 100+ categories render <500ms
- [ ] Performance test: Budget progress updates <500ms
- [ ] Performance test: No unnecessary re-renders (React DevTools Profiler)

## Data Integrity

### Validation
- [ ] Category names validated (1-50 characters, unique)
- [ ] Category colors validated (hex format #RRGGBB)
- [ ] Category icons validated (valid Lucide icon names)
- [ ] Budget amounts validated (positive integers in cents)
- [ ] Zod schemas enforce all validation rules

### Storage
- [ ] Categories persist to localStorage correctly
- [ ] Budgets persist to localStorage correctly
- [ ] Transactions persist categoryId correctly
- [ ] localStorage quota monitored (warn at 80%, block at 95%)

### Relationships
- [ ] One budget per category enforced
- [ ] Deleting category deletes budget (cascade)
- [ ] Deleting category uncategorizes transactions (nullify)
- [ ] Budget progress calculates from correct transactions

### Testing
- [ ] Edge case: Create category with duplicate name (should fail)
- [ ] Edge case: Create budget with $0 amount (should fail)
- [ ] Edge case: Delete category with 100+ transactions (should confirm)
- [ ] Edge case: localStorage quota exceeded (should warn/block)

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Firefox (latest) - All features work
- [ ] Safari (latest) - All features work
- [ ] Edge (latest) - All features work

## Mobile Compatibility
