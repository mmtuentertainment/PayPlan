# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete BNPL Removal

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (3 markers present - requires HIL decisions)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**3 Critical Clarifications Required** (Blocked on HIL Decisions):

1. **Constitutional Amendment**: Must resolve conflict with Principle III before implementation
2. **Phase 3 PR Resolution**: Decide fate of PR #59 (merge, close, or incorporate)
3. **Git History Handling**: Document approach for recovering deleted BNPL code

**Status**: Spec is high-quality and complete except for the 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. These require HIL strategic decisions before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`.
