# Specification Quality Checklist: Archive BNPL Code

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Validated**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Content Quality

- ✅ No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- ✅ Focused on user value and business needs
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- ✅ Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios are defined
- ✅ Edge cases are identified
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- ✅ All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows
- ✅ Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- ✅ No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Result**: All checklist items passed validation.

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. **Manual Test Directory Structure** - RESOLVED: Directory exists, create archived/ subdirectory
2. **Shared Utilities Extraction Strategy** - RESOLVED: Extract to lib/shared/ if circular deps found
3. **Archived Specs Indexing** - RESOLVED: Use simple README.md only (YAGNI principle)

**Research Methods Used**:
- PayPlan Research Assistant skill
- Constitution analysis (Phase 1 requirements, Principle VII)
- Codebase inspection (manual-tests/ directory, lib/ patterns)
- Architecture reference (existing organizational patterns)
- Existing documentation patterns (README examples)

**Next Steps**:
- ✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- ✅ All clarifications resolved with research-backed decisions
- ✅ No blocking issues remain
