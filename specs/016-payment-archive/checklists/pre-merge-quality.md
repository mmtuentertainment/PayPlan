**⚠️ GAPS IDENTIFIED (4 items)**:

### Critical Issues: None

### Minor Issues (4):

1. **CHK054 - Accessibility: Keyboard Navigation** [Gap]
   - **Issue**: No explicit keyboard navigation requirements in spec.md
   - **Found In**: Implemented in Task T115 but missing from FR/SC
   - **Recommendation**: Add FR-021: "System MUST support full keyboard navigation for all archive operations"

2. **CHK055 - Accessibility: ARIA Labels** [Gap]
   - **Issue**: No explicit ARIA label requirements in spec.md
   - **Found In**: Implemented in Tasks T114, T116 but missing from FR/SC
   - **Recommendation**: Add FR-022: "System MUST provide ARIA labels for all interactive elements per WCAG 2.1 AA"

3. **CHK064 - Multi-Currency Average Handling** [Ambiguity]
   - **Issue**: US3.4 specifies two different behaviors ("skip and show 'Multiple currencies'" OR "calculate for dominant currency with note")
   - **Location**: Spec §US3.4
   - **Recommendation**: Choose one behavior and update spec to remove "or"

4. **CHK065 - CSV Filename Slugification** [Ambiguity]
   - **Issue**: "Safely slugified" mentioned but replacement rules not specified
   - **Location**: Spec §US4.5, Edge Cases
   - **Recommendation**: Specify: "slugification replaces spaces with hyphens, removes emoji/special chars, converts to lowercase"

---

## Overall Assessment

**Grade**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (Excellent with minor gaps)

**Strengths**:
- Exceptionally well-structured with clear user stories and priorities
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-020)
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Extensive edge case coverage (11 scenarios)
- Clear dependencies and out-of-scope boundaries
- Excellent Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- Strong traceability between requirements and user stories

**Minor Improvements Needed**:
- Add 2 accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA) to FR section
- Resolve multi-currency average ambiguity (choose one behavior)
- Clarify slugification rules for CSV filenames

**Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVE for merge** - The 4 gaps are minor and don't block production deployment. Requirements are production-ready as comprehensive feature documentation. Consider addressing gaps in post-merge spec refinement or next feature iteration.

---

## Next Actions

1. **Optional**: Address 4 identified gaps by updating spec.md
2. **Proceed**: Merge PR #36 - requirements are solid foundation for production
3. **Post-Merge**: Document accessibility and slugification details in IMPLEMENTATION.md for reference
