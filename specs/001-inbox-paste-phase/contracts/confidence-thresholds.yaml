confidence_formula:
  description: |
    Weighted sum of matched extraction signals.
    Each signal is binary (1 if matched, 0 if not).
  formula: >
    confidence =
      provider_signal * 0.35 +
      date_signal * 0.25 +
      amount_signal * 0.20 +
      installment_signal * 0.15 +
      autopay_signal * 0.05

signals:
  - name: provider_signal
    weight: 0.35
    condition: "Provider detected (not 'Unknown')"
    rationale: "Most critical signal; gates all other extractions"

  - name: date_signal
    weight: 0.25
    condition: "Due date successfully extracted and parsed"
    rationale: "Essential for payment planning; second most important"

  - name: amount_signal
    weight: 0.20
    condition: "Payment amount successfully extracted"
    rationale: "Required for budgeting; third most important"

  - name: installment_signal
    weight: 0.15
    condition: "Installment number extracted (1-12)"
    rationale: "Helpful for tracking; less critical than amount/date"

  - name: autopay_signal
    weight: 0.05
    condition: "Autopay status detected (true/false)"
    rationale: "Useful but least critical; defaults to false if unclear"
