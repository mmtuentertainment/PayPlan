# Specification Quality Checklist: Dependency Cleanup (Phase 3)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Details**:

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Dependencies are mentioned as entities (npm packages) but not implementation specifics
- ✅ **User value focused**: All 4 user stories clearly articulate value (clean dependency tree, accurate documentation, system health validation, preserved BNPL functionality)
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for stakeholders, business-focused, avoids jargon except where necessary (e.g., "npm install")
- ✅ **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and filled out

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ **No clarification markers**: 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the spec
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: All 15 FRs are testable (e.g., FR-002: "remove ics@3.8.1" can be verified with `grep "ics" package.json`)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 SCs are measurable (e.g., SC-001: "completes in under 60 seconds", SC-003: "100% route availability")
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic SCs**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (install time, build success, route availability) not implementation (no mention of webpack, vite, typescript in SCs)
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 20+ Given/When/Then scenarios across 4 user stories
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases documented with mitigations
- ✅ **Scope bounded**: "Out of Scope (CRITICAL)" section explicitly excludes 8 items
- ✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: 4 dependencies listed, 5 assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ **FRs have acceptance criteria**: Each of the 15 FRs maps to user story acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-002 → US1 scenario 1)
- ✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 4 user stories (P1, P2, P1, P3) cover all critical flows: dependency removal, documentation update, validation, BNPL preservation
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes align**: 10 success criteria provide clear metrics for feature completion
- ✅ **No implementation leaks**: Spec maintains appropriate abstraction level (npm commands mentioned in validation steps are acceptable for developer-facing feature)

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- No issues found requiring spec updates
- All quality gates passed on first validation iteration
- Feature is low-complexity (Phase 3 cleanup), making comprehensive validation straightforward
