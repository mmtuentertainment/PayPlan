# Implementation Plan: Dependency Cleanup (Phase 3 of Product Pivot)

**Branch**: `064-short-name-dependency` | **Date**: 2025-10-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/064-short-name-dependency/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

⚠️ **REVISED AFTER PHASE 0 RESEARCH** ⚠️

Phase 3 of the product pivot focuses on **documentation update and validation** following the successful archival of BNPL code in Phase 2. **CRITICAL FINDING**: Research reveals that `ics@3.8.1` is NOT used only by archived code—it's actively used by two budget app features (Demo, Import) for calendar download functionality. Therefore, **dependency removal is not feasible**.

**Revised Scope**: Phase 3 will update README.md to reflect PayPlan's budget-first architecture and validate that all dependencies are correctly used.

**Technical Approach**:
1. ✅ Analyze dependency usage (COMPLETE - see research.md)
2. ❌ ~~Remove `ics@3.8.1`~~ (CANNOT DO - actively used by Demo, Import)
3. ✅ Verify all dependencies are needed (COMPLETE - all are actively used)
4. ✅ Update README.md to budget-first positioning (READY TO IMPLEMENT)
5. ✅ Manual testing of all 13 routes (Demo/Import `.ics` must work)
6. ✅ Validate build succeeds with 0 TypeScript errors

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours (documentation update + validation)

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8.3, Node.js 18+, npm 8+
**Primary Dependencies** (ALL KEPT - all actively used):
- **Keep**: ics@3.8.1 (calendar generation for Demo, Import `.ics` downloads + archived `lib/ics-generator.js`)
- **Keep**: luxon@3.7.2 (date/time library used by budget app)
- **Keep**: papaparse (CSV parsing for transaction import)
- **Keep**: recharts (charts for Dashboard Feature 062)

**Storage**: localStorage (client-side, privacy-first per Constitution Principle I)
**Testing**: Manual testing only (Phase 1 Definition of Done - no automated tests required)
**Target Platform**: Web application (React 19.1.1 + Vite 6.1.9, deployed on Vercel)
**Project Type**: Web (frontend-only, budget app with archived BNPL features)
**Performance Goals**:
- npm install completes in <60 seconds
- Build time remains stable (no degradation)
- Install time reduces by 5-10% after removing `ics`

**Constraints**:
- Zero user-facing changes (BNPL features remain accessible at `/bnpl`)
- Zero breaking changes to archived code functionality
- Phase 1 Definition of Done (manual testing only)
- YAGNI principle (remove dependencies ONLY if clearly unused)

**Scale/Scope**:
- 0 dependencies to remove (all are actively used)
- 4 dependencies to preserve (ics, luxon, papaparse, recharts)
- 1 documentation file to update (README.md)
- 13 routes to manually test (including Demo/Import `.ics` functionality)
- 60 archived BNPL files remain untouched

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Privacy-First Architecture ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: localStorage-first, no required authentication, PII sanitization, data ownership

**Compliance**:
- ✅ Feature operates entirely on local files (package.json, README.md)
- ✅ No server-side changes required
- ✅ No authentication needed (developer-focused cleanup task)
- ✅ No PII involved (removing npm dependency metadata)
- ✅ Users maintain full data ownership (localStorage unchanged)

**Verification**: FR-014 requires following Phase 1 Definition of Done (manual testing only)

---

### Principle II: Accessibility-First Development ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation

**Compliance**:
- ✅ No UI changes (developer-focused infrastructure task)
- ✅ Validation includes testing `/bnpl` route accessibility (US4 scenario 4)
- ✅ Manual testing ensures no accessibility regressions
- ✅ Browser console must show 0 errors (FR-011)

**Verification**:
- User Story 4 includes keyboard navigation test for BNPL features
- Edge case documented: browser cache causing stale routes
- Validation step 10: Check browser console for errors

---

### Principle III: Free Core, Premium Optional ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: BNPL features remain free and accessible forever

**Compliance**:
- ✅ Out of Scope explicitly excludes "Removing BNPL features"
- ✅ Out of Scope explicitly excludes "Breaking changes to BNPL functionality"
- ✅ User Story 4 (P3) ensures BNPL features remain accessible at `/bnpl`
- ✅ SC-009: Zero user-facing changes (BNPL features remain accessible)
- ✅ Validation step 7: Manual test `/bnpl` route to verify functionality

**Verification**: Phase 3 completes the pivot while maintaining Constitutional guarantee that BNPL features stay free

---

### Principle IV: Visual-First Insights ✅ PASS (N/A)

**Requirement**: Charts for everything, color-coded status, progress bars

**Compliance**: N/A - This feature does not involve UI changes or visual components

**Verification**: Dependency cleanup is infrastructure-only; no visual changes required

---

### Principle V: Mobile-First Responsive Design ✅ PASS (N/A)

**Requirement**: Design for small screens first, touch-friendly UI

**Compliance**: N/A - This feature does not involve UI changes

**Verification**: Infrastructure task; responsive design not applicable

---

### Principle VI: Quality-First (Phased) ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: Phase 1 (0-100 users) = Manual testing only, ship fast

**Compliance**:
- ✅ FR-014: System MUST follow Phase 1 Definition of Done (manual testing only)
- ✅ Out of Scope: "Automated test creation" deferred to Phase 2
- ✅ 13 validation steps defined for manual testing
- ✅ User Story 3 (P1): System Health Validation via manual testing

**Verification**:
- Spec explicitly states "Phase 1 Definition of Done requires manual testing only"
- Validation steps enumerate all 9 routes to manually test
- Browser console check included (0 errors required)

---

### Principle VII: Simplicity / YAGNI ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: Small features (<2 weeks), incremental delivery, clear purpose

**Compliance**:
- ✅ SC-007: Phase 3 completed within 1-2 hours (low complexity, low risk)
- ✅ FR-015: System MUST follow YAGNI principle (remove dependencies ONLY if clearly unused)
- ✅ Feature has clear purpose: remove unused dependency, update documentation
- ✅ Incremental approach: analyze → remove → verify → test → commit
- ✅ No over-engineering: simple grep/npm ls analysis, manual testing

**Verification**:
- Feature scoped to 1-2 hours
- Single dependency removal (`ics`)
- Simple documentation update (README.md)
- No complex refactoring or architectural changes

---

### **Overall Constitution Compliance: ✅ ALL GATES PASSED**

**Summary**:
- All 7 Constitutional principles evaluated
- Principles I, II, III, VI, VII directly applicable and compliant
- Principles IV, V not applicable (infrastructure task, no UI changes)
- Zero violations requiring justification
- Feature aligns perfectly with Phase 1 requirements (manual testing, ship fast, YAGNI)

**Post-Design Re-Check**: Will verify after Phase 1 that:
- README.md accurately reflects budget-first architecture (Principle III)
- No accessibility regressions introduced (Principle II)
- Manual testing validates zero user-facing changes (Principles I, III)

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend-only). Active budget app code lives in `frontend/src/`, archived BNPL code lives in `frontend/src/archive/bnpl/`. This feature modifies `frontend/package.json` to remove the `ics` dependency and updates `README.md` at the repository root to reflect budget-first architecture. No source code changes required; this is purely a dependency cleanup and documentation update task.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

**Status**: N/A - Zero Constitutional violations detected

This feature has **zero complexity violations**:
- ✅ All Constitutional principles pass
- ✅ No patterns that violate simplicity
- ✅ No architectural decisions that require justification
- ✅ Perfectly aligned with Phase 1 requirements (manual testing, ship fast, YAGNI)

**Rationale for No Violations**:
- Feature is a straightforward cleanup task (remove 1 dependency, update 1 doc file)
- No new abstractions or patterns introduced
- Follows existing Phase 1-3 pivot strategy
- Maintains all Constitutional guarantees (BNPL features stay free and accessible)

## Phase 0: Research & Analysis

**Objective**: Resolve all unknowns in Technical Context and identify dependency usage patterns.

### Research Tasks

1. **Dependency Usage Analysis**
   - **Question**: Is `ics@3.8.1` truly used ONLY by archived code?
   - **Method**: `grep -r "import.*from 'ics'" frontend/src --exclude-dir=archive`
   - **Expected**: Zero matches (confirms only archived code uses it)
   - **Risk**: If active code uses `ics`, removal would break builds

2. **Transitive Dependency Check**
   - **Question**: Do any other npm packages depend on `ics`?
   - **Method**: `npm ls ics --all`
   - **Expected**: Only `ics@3.8.1` appears (direct dependency, not transitive)
   - **Risk**: If another package depends on `ics`, removal may cause conflicts

3. **Shared Dependency Verification**
   - **Question**: Are `luxon`, `papaparse`, `recharts` used by active budget app code?
   - **Method**: `grep -r "import.*from 'luxon'" frontend/src --exclude-dir=archive` (repeat for each)
   - **Expected**: Multiple matches in active code (confirms shared usage)
   - **Risk**: Accidentally removing shared deps would break budget app

4. **README.md Content Analysis**
   - **Question**: What sections of README.md need updating to reflect budget-first?
   - **Method**: Read current README.md, identify BNPL-focused sections
   - **Expected**: Product description, feature list, architecture sections need updates
   - **Risk**: Inconsistent messaging if updates are incomplete

5. **Route Enumeration**
   - **Question**: What are all 9 routes that need manual testing?
   - **Method**: Check `frontend/src/App.tsx` for route definitions
   - **Expected**: `/dashboard`, `/categories`, `/budgets`, `/transactions`, `/bnpl`, `/demo`, `/import`, and 2 others
   - **Risk**: Missing routes in validation would leave regressions undetected

### Output

**File**: `research.md` ✅ **COMPLETE** (See [research.md](research.md))

**Actual Findings**:
- ❌ `ics` usage NOT archived-only - actively used by Demo.tsx and Import.tsx
- ✅ No transitive dependencies on `ics` (direct dependency only)
- ✅ Shared dependencies confirmed as actively used
- ⏳ README.md sections to be identified during implementation
- ✅ Complete route list enumerated (13 routes from App.tsx)

**Decisions Documented**:
- Decision: **KEEP `ics@3.8.1`** dependency
- Rationale: Actively used by Demo/Import calendar download features (user-facing functionality)
- Alternative Rejected: Remove dependency (would break user-facing features, violates Constitution)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites**: `research.md` complete with all dependency usage confirmed

### Data Model (`data-model.md`)

**Entities**:

1. **npm Dependency**
   - Attributes: name (string), version (string), type (direct|dev|transitive)
   - Relationships: appears in package.json, may be used by source files
   - State: installed → removed
   - Validation: Semantic versioning (e.g., `3.8.1`)

2. **Documentation File**
   - Attributes: path (string), content (markdown), last_modified (timestamp)
   - Relationships: describes project architecture and features
   - State: outdated → updated
   - Validation: Markdown syntax valid, headings present

3. **Git Commit**
   - Attributes: message (string), author (string), timestamp (datetime)
   - Relationships: records changes to files
   - State: staged → committed
   - Validation: Conventional Commits format (`chore(deps): ...`)

### Contracts (`contracts/`)

**Note**: This feature has no API contracts (developer-facing infrastructure task). Instead, we define **file contracts**:

**Contract 1: package.json Modification**
```typescript
// Before (has ics dependency)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ics": "^3.8.1",
    "luxon": "^3.7.2",
    "papaparse": "^5.5.3",
    "recharts": "^2.15.0"
  }
}

// After (ics removed, shared deps preserved)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "luxon": "^3.7.2",
    "papaparse": "^5.5.3",
    "recharts": "^2.15.0"
  }
}
```

**Contract 2: README.md Structure**
```markdown
# Before (BNPL-focused)
## PayPlan - BNPL Debt Management App
Track your Buy Now, Pay Later purchases...

## After (Budget-first)
## PayPlan - Privacy-First Budgeting App
Track your spending, budgets, and goals. With BNPL tracking as a differentiator...
```

**Contract 3: Git Commit Message**
```text
Format: chore(deps): remove ics dependency used only by archived BNPL code

Body:
- Remove ics@3.8.1 (used only by archived lib/ics-generator.js)
- Preserve luxon, papaparse, recharts (actively used by budget app)
- Update README.md to reflect budget-first architecture
- Mark Phase 3 complete in specs/063-short-name-archive/plan.md
