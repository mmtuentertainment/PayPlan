# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard with Charts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Complete**: All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Details

#### Content Quality ✓
- **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement (Recharts, React, localStorage mentioned only in Dependencies/Assumptions sections, not in requirements)
- **User-focused**: All requirements written from user perspective ("users can view", "users see", "users understand")
- **Non-technical language**: Business stakeholder can understand all user stories and success criteria
- **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope, Dependencies) present

#### Requirement Completeness ✓
- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are clear with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., "FR-011: Dashboard loads in <1 second" is measurable)
- **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 through SC-010 all include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user outcomes, not system internals (e.g., "Users can view dashboard in <1 second" not "React components render in <1s")
- **Acceptance scenarios complete**: Each user story has 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases documented**: 7 edge cases identified with clear handling strategies
- **Scope bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly lists 8 deferred features
- **Dependencies clear**: External (Recharts, Radix UI), Internal (Feature 061, Goals), and Constitutional dependencies documented

#### Feature Readiness ✓
- **Requirements → Acceptance criteria linkage**: Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- **Primary flows covered**: 6 user stories cover spending breakdown (P0), income vs. expenses (P0), recent transactions (P1), upcoming bills (P1), goal progress (P1), gamification (P2)
- **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria provide clear measurement targets
- **No implementation leaks**: Technical Constraints section appropriately separates performance/accessibility requirements from implementation details

### Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers

The specification makes informed guesses for all potentially ambiguous areas, with assumptions documented:

1. **Chart library**: Recharts (Assumption #1) - React-friendly, accessible, standard choice
2. **Data retention**: Current month + last 30 days (Assumption #2) - Industry standard
3. **Widget priority**: Clear P0/P1/P2 prioritization (Assumption #3)
4. **Empty states**: Show helpful messages (Assumption #4) - Standard UX pattern
5. **Error handling**: User-friendly messages (Assumption #5) - Standard practice
6. **Performance**: Standard web expectations (Assumption #6) - No users complained yet
7. **Gamification scope**: Basic in Phase 1 (Assumption #7) - Aligned with Phase 1 velocity focus
8. **Goal tracking**: Hide widget if feature not available (Assumption #8) - Graceful degradation
9. **Mobile layout**: Stack vertically (Assumption #9) - Mobile-first principle
10. **Color scheme**: Follow brand colors (Assumption #10) - Consistent with existing design

All assumptions are reasonable defaults that don't require explicit HIL clarification.

### Constitutional Alignment

Specification aligns with all constitutional requirements:

- **Privacy-First** (Principle I): FR-010 (localStorage aggregation), no server required
- **Accessibility-First** (Principle II): FR-014 (WCAG 2.1 AA), SC-006 (accessibility audit), detailed accessibility requirements in Technical Constraints
- **Free Core** (Principle III): Dashboard is Tier 0 feature, always free
- **Visual-First** (Principle IV): 6 widgets with charts (pie, bar, progress bars)
- **Mobile-First** (Principle V): FR-013 (responsive), SC-004 (mobile/tablet/desktop testing)
- **Quality-First** (Principle VI, Phase 1): Manual testing only (Out of Scope: automated tests)
- **Simplicity/YAGNI** (Principle VII): Clear scope boundaries, 8 features deferred to Phase 2+

### Recommendation

**✅ PROCEED** to `/speckit.plan` - Specification is complete, high-quality, and ready for implementation planning.
