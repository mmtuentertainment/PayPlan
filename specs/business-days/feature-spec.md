# Feature Specification: Business-Day Awareness (v0.1.2)

**Feature Branch**: `004-business-day-awareness`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Version**: v0.1.2 (minor release)

---

## Why This Feature

Reduce false WEEKEND_AUTOPAY flags and incorrect calendar dates by shifting weekend/holiday-due installments to the next business day, offline, without external integrations.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A PayPlan user inputs payment data with some installments due on weekends or US Federal holidays. With Business-Day Mode enabled (default), the system automatically shifts these dates to the next business day, eliminating false weekend autopay warnings and ensuring calendar reminders align with when banks actually process payments. The user sees clear annotations showing which dates were shifted and why, helping them plan accurately without manual date adjustments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an installment due on Saturday (2025-10-04), **When** Business-Day Mode is enabled (default), **Then**:
   - Due date shifts to Monday (2025-10-06)
   - ICS event created for Monday, not Saturday
   - WEEKEND_AUTOPAY risk NOT raised
   - SHIFTED_NEXT_BUSINESS_DAY informational flag added
   - movedDates[] includes record showing shift
   - normalized[] shows wasShifted: true, originalDueDate, shiftedDueDate

2. **Given** an installment due on Thanksgiving (US Federal holiday, Thursday 2025-11-27), **When** country="US" and Business-Day Mode enabled, **Then**:
   - Due date shifts to next business day (**Fri 2025-11-28**)
   - Shift reason: "HOLIDAY"
   - Calendar event created on **Fri 2025-11-28**
   - movedDates shows holiday shift

3. **Given** user provides customSkipDates: ["2025-10-15"] (company closure), **When** an installment is due on 2025-10-15, **Then**:
   - Date shifts to 2025-10-16 (next business day)
   - Shift reason: "CUSTOM"
   - movedDates includes this shift

4. **Given** installment due on Friday before a 3-day weekend (holiday Monday), **When** due date is Friday, **Then**:
   - Date NOT shifted (Friday is a business day)
   - No shift annotation

5. **Given** Business-Day Mode is disabled (businessDayMode: false), **When** processing installments, **Then**:
   - NO date shifting occurs
   - Original v0.1.1 behavior (WEEKEND_AUTOPAY flags as before)
   - movedDates[] is empty

6. **Given** country="None", **When** processing dates, **Then**:
   - Only weekends (Sat/Sun) are considered non-business days
   - US Federal holidays are treated as business days
   - Shifts occur only for weekend dates

### Edge Cases
- Multiple consecutive non-business days (Fri‚ÜíSat‚ÜíSun‚ÜíMon holiday)
- Year boundary (Dec 31 weekend + Jan 1 holiday)
- Leap year Feb 29
- Invalid customSkipDates format
- customSkipDates with past dates
- Timezone affects day-of-week (weekend in one TZ, weekday in another)
- All installments due on weekends (large shift count)

## Success Criteria

**Primary:** A user with payment data containing at least one weekend and one US Federal holiday due date receives a plan with zero false WEEKEND_AUTOPAY flags, correct shifted calendar dates, and visible shift annotations - all in <60 seconds.

**Black-Box Acceptance:**

**Test 1: Weekend Shift**
```json
Input: due_date = "2025-10-04" (Saturday), autopay = true, businessDayMode = true
Output:
- shiftedDueDate = "2025-10-06" (Monday)
- wasShifted = true, shiftReason = "WEEKEND"
- No WEEKEND_AUTOPAY flag
- SHIFTED_NEXT_BUSINESS_DAY present
- ICS event on 2025-10-06
- movedDates includes shift record
```

**Test 2: Holiday Shift**
```json
Input: due_date = "2025-11-27" (Thanksgiving), country = "US"
Output:
- shiftedDueDate = "2025-11-28" (Friday, next business day)
- shiftReason = "HOLIDAY"
- ICS event on 2025-11-28
```

**Test 3: Custom Skip Date**
```json
Input: due_date = "2025-10-15", customSkipDates = ["2025-10-15"]
Output:
- shiftedDueDate = "2025-10-16"
- shiftReason = "CUSTOM"
```

**Test 4: Business-Day Mode OFF**
```json
Input: due_date = "2025-10-04" (Saturday), businessDayMode = false
Output:
- shiftedDueDate = "2025-10-04" (unchanged)
- wasShifted = false
- WEEKEND_AUTOPAY flag raised (v0.1.1 behavior)
```

**Test 5: No Shift Needed**
```json
Input: due_date = "2025-10-03" (Friday)
Output:
- shiftedDueDate = "2025-10-03" (unchanged)
- wasShifted = false
```

## Out of Scope for v0.1.2

- ‚ùå Provider-specific charging calendars (some providers may charge on weekends)
- ‚ùå Country packs beyond US (UK, CA, EU holidays)
- ‚ùå Bank-specific holiday calendars
- ‚ùå Email/receipt parsing to detect original dates
- ‚ùå Historical data corrections (past dates)
- ‚ùå Persistence or user preferences storage
- ‚ùå Observed holiday logic complexity (simplified: use actual date)
- ‚ùå Business hours or time-of-day shifting
- ‚ùå Backward shifting (always forward to next business day)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Holiday accuracy | Wrong shifts if data outdated | Ship offline list for 2025-2026; document yearly refresh needed |
| UX confusion | Users don't understand why date changed | Clear "Shifted" badges with tooltips; movedDates[] API field |
| Timezone bugs | Wrong day-of-week in different TZ | All calculations use user's selected timezone |
| Performance | Slow with many dates | Optimize with Set lookups; target <50ms for 2k dates |
| Backward compat | Breaks v0.1.1 clients | Default businessDayMode=true maintains expected behavior |
