# Feature Specification: Realign PayPlan Specs to Modular Extraction Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `002-realign-payplan-specs`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Realign PayPlan specs to current modular extraction architecture (no runtime change)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Documentation realignment for modular extraction architecture
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Documentation maintainers, developers, CI systems
   ’ Actions: Update specs, create mapping docs, add CI gates, update references
   ’ Data: Module paths, test locations, performance benchmarks
   ’ Constraints: No runtime changes, no backend edits, no behavior changes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly defined in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary scenario: Developer navigating updated specs to understand extraction architecture
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Documentation updates, delta tracking, CI specifications
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Spec documents, module paths, test suites, CI configurations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details - only documentation structure
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT documentation needs updating and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no editor commands, file operations)
- =e Written for documentation maintainers and spec reviewers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or documentation maintainer, I need the PayPlan specifications to accurately reflect the current modular extraction architecture so that I can understand the codebase structure, navigate to correct file paths, and verify that all components are properly documented and tested.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** outdated spec references to old file paths, **When** specs are realigned, **Then** all module references point to current extraction architecture paths
2. **Given** no documentation of the architectural migration, **When** realignment delta is created, **Then** developers can see the old’new path mappings and migration rationale
3. **Given** no CI performance gates, **When** CI spec is added, **Then** automated tests enforce performance benchmarks (50 emails <2s) and upload artifacts
4. **Given** missing confidence legend documentation, **When** UI/docs are updated, **Then** users understand confidence scores on results and CSV exports
5. **Given** test files in new locations, **When** specs are updated, **Then** all test references point to frontend/tests/** structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when old spec references are still used by external documentation? ’ Delta file provides migration guide
- How does system handle performance regression? ’ CI gates fail build if benchmarks not met
- What if confidence legend is misunderstood? ’ Clear component reference and CSV documentation line added

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Documentation Structure**
- **FR-001**: System MUST create `specs/realignment/feature-spec.md` documenting the modular extraction architecture realignment
- **FR-002**: System MUST update all prior specs/plans/tasks to reference current module paths in extraction architecture
- **FR-003**: System MUST create `ops/deltas/0013_realignment.md` with complete old’new path mappings and migration rationale

**Module Path References**
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST reference provider modules at:
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/providers/detector.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/providers/patterns.ts`
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST reference extractor modules at:
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/amount.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/autopay.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/currency.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/date.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/installment.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/extractors/late-fee.ts`
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST reference helper modules at:
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/cache.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/confidence-calculator.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/domain-validator.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/date-detector.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/date-reparser.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/error-sanitizer.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/timezone.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/field-extractor.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/regex-profiler.ts`
  - `frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/redaction.ts`
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST reference test locations under `frontend/tests/**` structure (unit, integration, performance)

**CI Gates & Performance**
- **FR-008**: System MUST specify CI performance gate: 50 emails processed in <2 seconds
- **FR-009**: System MUST document Swagger lazy-loading requirement to maintain performance
- **FR-010**: System MUST specify that performance benchmarks run in CI and upload artifacts
- **FR-011**: CI specification MUST include automated verification that performance gates pass before merge

**UI & Documentation Enhancements**
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST reference "Confidence legend" component on results display
- **FR-013**: Documentation MUST include CSV export documentation line explaining confidence scores

**Non-Goals (Explicit Constraints)**
- **FR-014**: Realignment MUST NOT include backend code edits
- **FR-015**: Realignment MUST NOT change runtime behavior or functionality
- **FR-016**: Realignment MUST focus exclusively on documentation accuracy

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Spec Documents**: Existing specification files in `specs/` that reference outdated module paths and need updates to reflect current architecture
- **Delta File**: Migration documentation (`ops/deltas/0013_realignment.md`) mapping old paths to new paths with rationale for each change
- **Module Paths**: Current extraction architecture paths organized into providers/, extractors/, and helpers/ subdirectories
- **Test Suite Locations**: Test files relocated to `frontend/tests/**` with unit, integration, and performance subdirectories
- **CI Configuration**: Performance gate specifications including benchmark thresholds, Swagger optimization, and artifact upload requirements
- **UI Documentation**: Component references and CSV export documentation explaining confidence legend to end users
