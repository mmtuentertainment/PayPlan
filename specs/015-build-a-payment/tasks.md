# Tasks: Payment Status Tracking System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-build-a-payment/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature follows Test-Driven Development (TDD). All tests MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- **Backend**: No backend changes required (privacy-first localStorage only)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and type definitions that ALL user stories depend on

- [x] T001 Ensure uuid package (v13.0.0) is installed in frontend/package.json
- [x] T002 [P] Create PaymentStatusRecord type in frontend/src/lib/payment-status/types.ts
- [x] T003 [P] Create PaymentStatusCollection type in frontend/src/lib/payment-status/types.ts
- [x] T004 [P] Create StorageError type and Result<T, E> types in frontend/src/lib/payment-status/types.ts

- [x] T007 [P] Extend Payment type with optional id, paid_status, paid_timestamp fields in frontend/src/types/csvExport.ts

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Type system ready - all user stories can reference these types

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T011 [P] Add timestamp formatting utility (ISO 8601) in frontend/src/lib/payment-status/utils.ts

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable (just needs US1's storage layer)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable (builds on US1's storage)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with existing exports (independently testable)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable (uses US1's storage)

### Within Each User Story

1. **Tests FIRST**: All test tasks MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. **Storage Layer**: Implement PaymentStatusStorage methods
3. **Service Layer**: Implement PaymentStatusService methods (depends on storage)
4. **React Hooks**: Create hooks using services (depends on service layer)
5. **UI Components**: Build UI components (depends on hooks)
6. **Integration**: Wire components into existing views (depends on components)
7. **Verify Tests PASS**: All tests for the story should now pass

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 (all types/schemas)
- **Foundational Phase**: T010, T011 (utilities)
- **Within Each User Story**:
  - All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
  - Storage methods marked [P] can run in parallel (different methods)
  - Service methods marked [P] can run in parallel (different methods)
  - UI components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Stories**: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 can all be worked on in parallel by different developers (after Foundational phase)
- **Polish Phase**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Write all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - MUST FAIL initially):
Task: T012, T013, T014, T015, T016, T017, T018, T019, T020

# Verify all tests FAIL, then implement storage methods in parallel:
Task: T021, T022, T023, T024, T025, T026, T027

# Implement service methods in parallel:
Task: T028, T029, T030, T031

# Build UI components in parallel:
Task: T034, T035, T036, T037

# Verify all tests now PASS
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T011) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKER

   - Write tests FIRST (T012-T020) ‚úÖ
   - Verify tests FAIL ‚ùå
   - Implement (T021-T040)
   - Verify tests PASS ‚úÖ

2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T012-T040) - Core functionality
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T041-T047) - Risk integration
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T048-T059) - Bulk operations
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (T060-T069) - Export integration
   - **Developer E**: User Story 5 (T070-T079) - Clear all feature
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD CRITICAL**: Write tests FIRST, verify they FAIL, implement, verify they PASS
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Use quickstart.md for manual validation of each user story
- Follow contracts in specs/015-build-a-payment/contracts/ exactly
- Reference data-model.md for entity structures and validation rules
- Reference research.md for technical decisions and patterns
