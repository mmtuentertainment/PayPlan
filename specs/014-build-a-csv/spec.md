# Feature Specification: CSV Export for Payment Schedules

**Feature Branch**: `014-build-a-csv`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a CSV export feature for PayPlan that allows users to download their processed payment schedules as a CSV file. When a user has successfully processed payments (either via email extraction or CSV import), they should see a 'Download CSV' button next to the existing 'Download .ics' button. The exported CSV should use the same format as the import CSV (provider, amount, currency, dueISO, autopay columns) to enable round-trip compatibility, but should also include additional columns for calculated risk information (risk_type, risk_severity, risk_message). The export must be completely client-side with no server uploads, maintaining PayPlan's privacy-first approach. Users should be able to open the downloaded CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet software for further analysis, sharing with family members, or importing into personal finance tools."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

---

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: How should missing risk data be represented in exported CSV columns? → A: Empty strings ("") per RFC 4180 CSV standard for maximum compatibility with spreadsheet software and clean round-trip import
- Q: What filename format should be used for downloaded CSV files? → A: `payplan-export-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.csv` using ISO 8601 timestamp to prevent file overwrites and enable version tracking
- Q: How should the system handle exports with 1000+ payment records? → A: Warn users when export exceeds 500 records about potential browser performance impact, but allow them to proceed with the export

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a PayPlan user who has processed their payment schedule (via email extraction or CSV import), I want to export my payment data as a CSV file so that I can analyze it in spreadsheet software, share it with family members, or import it into personal finance tools for budgeting purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has successfully processed payments via email extraction, **When** they click the "Download CSV" button, **Then** a CSV file is downloaded to their device containing all payment records with original import columns (provider, amount, currency, dueISO, autopay) plus calculated risk columns (risk_type, risk_severity, risk_message).

2. **Given** a user has imported payments via CSV upload, **When** they export the processed schedule as CSV, **Then** the exported file uses the same column format as the original import file to enable round-trip compatibility.

3. **Given** a user opens the exported CSV in Excel or Google Sheets, **When** they view the file, **Then** all columns are properly formatted, text is not truncated, and numerical values are correctly interpreted by the spreadsheet software.

4. **Given** a user has no processed payments in their current session, **When** they view the results area, **Then** the "Download CSV" button is not visible or is disabled.

5. **Given** a user downloads an exported CSV, **When** they re-import that CSV into PayPlan, **Then** the system correctly processes all payment records without data loss or format errors.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a payment has missing risk data (e.g., no risk detected)? Risk columns (risk_type, risk_severity, risk_message) must use empty strings ("") per RFC 4180 CSV standard.
- How does the system handle special characters in provider names (commas, quotes, newlines)? System must properly escape CSV values to prevent malformed files.
- What happens when currency symbols or non-ASCII characters appear in payment data? System must preserve Unicode characters correctly in the exported file.
- What filename format should be used for the downloaded CSV? System must use format `payplan-export-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.csv` with ISO 8601 timestamp to prevent file overwrites and enable version tracking.
- How should the system handle very large payment schedules (e.g., 1000+ records)? System must warn users when export exceeds 500 records about potential performance impact, but allow them to proceed with the export.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Download CSV" button in the results area that appears only when processed payments exist
- **FR-002**: System MUST export CSV files containing columns: provider, amount, currency, dueISO, autopay (matching import format)
- **FR-003**: System MUST include additional columns in exports: risk_type, risk_severity, risk_message (calculated risk data)
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform all CSV generation and download operations client-side without server uploads, maintaining privacy-first approach
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate CSV files that are compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, and standard spreadsheet software
- **FR-006**: System MUST properly escape special characters (commas, quotes, newlines) in CSV values to prevent malformed files
- **FR-007**: Exported CSV files MUST support round-trip compatibility (re-import into PayPlan without data loss)
- **FR-008**: System MUST position the "Download CSV" button next to the existing "Download .ics" button for consistent UI placement
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all payment data exactly as processed, including currency symbols and non-ASCII characters
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle cases where payments have no risk data by using empty strings ("") in risk columns (risk_type, risk_severity, risk_message) per RFC 4180 standard
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate download filenames in format `payplan-export-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.csv` using ISO 8601 timestamp to prevent overwrites
- **FR-012**: System MUST warn users when exporting more than 500 payment records about potential browser performance impact, while allowing export to proceed

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Payment Record**: Represents a single bill payment with attributes: provider name, payment amount, currency code, due date (ISO format), autopay status (boolean), and calculated risk information (type, severity, message)
- **Risk Information**: Associated with each payment, containing risk classification data: risk type (category of risk detected), severity level (impact assessment), and descriptive message (user-facing explanation)
- **CSV Export**: A file artifact containing all payment records in tabular format with headers, supporting both core payment attributes and extended risk metadata
