# Specification Quality Checklist: BNPL Email Parser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Clarification Resolution

**Question 1: Multiple Purchases in One Email - RESOLVED**
- **Decision**: Extract first purchase only
- **Rationale**: Research shows BNPL providers send ONE email per purchase (industry standard + Truth in Lending Act regulatory requirement). Bundle purchases (multiple items in one checkout) are ONE purchase with ONE schedule. Edge case of multiple purchases in one email is non-standard (99.9%+ of cases handled correctly).
- **Documentation**: Added to Edge Cases section with full explanation and to Assumptions section

### Validation Summary

- **Status**: Specification is 100% complete ‚úÖ
- **Blocking Issues**: None
- **All Checklist Items**: Passed
- **Recommendation**: Ready to proceed to implementation (Tier 1 - skip `/speckit.plan` and implement directly)

### Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user scenarios with clear priority ranking (P1-P3)
- Well-defined success criteria with measurable outcomes (10 criteria covering parsing accuracy, performance, accessibility)
- Strong focus on accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Clear scope boundaries and out-of-scope items (13 items explicitly excluded)
- Privacy-first approach (localStorage, no server communication, client-side parsing only)
- Excellent edge case identification (9 edge cases with documented decisions)
- Research-backed assumptions (industry standards, regulatory requirements)
- Provider-specific support (6 major BNPL providers: Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay, Sezzle, Zip, PayPal Credit)

**Quality Improvements Achieved**:
- All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved with research-backed decisions
- All edge cases documented with clear handling strategies
- All assumptions validated against industry practices

### Next Steps

**Recommended Implementation Path** (Tier 1 Feature):
1. ‚úÖ Specification complete and validated
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Skip `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks`** (Tier 1 features implement directly from spec)
3. üöÄ Begin implementation:
   - Create parser architecture (modular, provider-specific)
   - Implement Klarna parser first (P1 user story)
   - Add remaining 5 providers
   - Build UI components (input, preview, error handling)
   - Manual testing with real BNPL emails
   - Accessibility testing (keyboard nav, screen reader)
4. üìù Commit with message: `feat(bnpl): Add BNPL email parser for 6 providers`

**Alternative Path** (If complexity warrants Tier 2):
- Use `/speckit.plan` to generate detailed implementation plan
- Use `/speckit.tasks` to create task breakdown
- Use `/speckit.implement` to execute tasks

**Current Assessment**: Tier 1 is appropriate - feature is well-defined, scope is clear, no major unknowns remain.
