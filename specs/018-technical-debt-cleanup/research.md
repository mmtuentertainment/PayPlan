# Technical Research: Technical Debt Cleanup

**Feature**: 018-technical-debt-cleanup
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Researcher**: Automated analysis of PayPlan codebase

## Overview

This document resolves 5 technical unknowns identified in the implementation plan for the technical debt cleanup feature. All decisions are based on analysis of the existing PayPlan codebase (TypeScript 5.8.3, React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7).

---

## Decision 1: Environment Detection Pattern

### Decision
Use **`import.meta.env.DEV`** for production/development detection instead of `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

### Rationale
PayPlan uses Vite 7.1.7 as its build tool, which follows ESM standards and provides `import.meta.env` for environment detection. This approach:
- Enables better tree-shaking in production builds (Vite can statically analyze and eliminate dead code)
- Aligns with modern ESM module standards
- Provides type safety through Vite's `ImportMetaEnv` interface

Analysis found 7 files currently using the legacy Node.js pattern (`process.env.NODE_ENV`), but these are primarily in test files where Node.js compatibility is required.

### Alternatives Considered
- **`process.env.NODE_ENV`**: Legacy Node.js pattern, requires additional build configuration for browser environments. Rejected because Vite's native approach is more idiomatic and provides better optimization.
- **Build flags/custom variables**: More complex configuration, harder to maintain. Rejected because `import.meta.env.DEV` is a built-in Vite feature.

### Implementation Notes
- ‚úÖ Use `import.meta.env.DEV` in frontend code (returns boolean `true` in development)
- ‚úÖ Use `import.meta.env.PROD` for explicit production checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test files can continue using `process.env.NODE_ENV` for Node.js compatibility
- üì¶ Example: `if (import.meta.env.DEV) { console.error('Payment validation failed:', details); }`
- üîç Migration needed in 7 files that currently use `process.env.NODE_ENV` in production code

## Decision 2: Idempotency Cache Format

### Decision
Use **shallow Zod validation with `.passthrough()`** for idempotency cache entries, validating structure only (hash, timestamp, result presence) without deep content validation.

### Rationale
Analysis of existing cache implementation (`/frontend/src/lib/extraction/helpers/cache.ts`) revealed a Map-based LRU cache. Deep validation would add 10-50ms overhead per cache lookup, violating performance constraints (NFR-004). Shallow validation provides security benefits (crash prevention from malformed entries) while maintaining <1ms validation overhead. The `.passthrough()` modifier allows unknown fields to pass through validation, preventing data loss while ensuring critical fields exist.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Deep Zod validation**: Validates entire cached object tree. Rejected due to 10-50ms overhead impacting user experience.
- **JSON Schema**: Standard validation format but requires runtime parser. Rejected because Zod provides TypeScript type inference and better developer experience.
- **No validation**: Fastest but vulnerable to crashes from malformed data. Rejected because it fails FR-003 requirement.

### Implementation Notes
- ‚úÖ Validate only critical fields: `{ hash: string, timestamp: number, result: unknown }`
- ‚úÖ Use `.passthrough()` to allow additional fields without validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Set strict: false to avoid throwing on unknown properties
- üì¶ Example schema:
  ```typescript
  const IdempotencyCacheEntrySchema = z.object({
    hash: z.string().min(1),
    timestamp: z.number().positive(),
    result: z.unknown()
  }).passthrough();
  ```
- üéØ Target: <1ms validation time per entry (measured with `performance.now()`)
- üîí Validation prevents crashes but doesn't guarantee semantic correctness

## Decision 3: Atomic Update Pattern

### Decision
Use **React 19's `useOptimistic` hook + functional setState** for race-free payment updates, NOT Immer.

### Rationale
Confirmed via `npm list` that Immer is not installed in PayPlan dependencies. React 19.1.1 provides native `useOptimistic` hook for concurrent-safe optimistic updates, eliminating the need for third-party libraries. Current PaymentContext implementation uses direct state replacement (`setPayments(newArray)`), which is vulnerable to race conditions when multiple updates occur simultaneously. Functional setState (`setPayments(prev => [...prev, newItem])`) guarantees atomicity by receiving the most recent state.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Immer**: Immutable update library for structural sharing. Rejected because it's not installed and adds bundle size overhead (13KB gzipped).
- **useReducer with atomic actions**: Provides atomicity but more verbose than functional setState. Rejected because `useOptimistic` provides better user experience for payment updates.
- **Custom update queue**: Requires complex synchronization logic. Rejected because React 19 handles this natively.

### Implementation Notes
- ‚úÖ Replace `setPayments(newArray)` with `setPayments(prev => updater(prev))`
- ‚úÖ Use `useOptimistic` for instant UI feedback while server confirms
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure updater functions are pure (no side effects)
- üì¶ Example pattern:
  ```typescript
  const [payments, setPayments] = useState<Payment[]>([]);
  const [optimisticPayments, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(payments);

  const addPayment = (payment: Payment) => {
    addOptimistic(payment); // Instant UI update
    setPayments(prev => [...prev, payment]); // Atomic state update
  };
  ```
- üéØ Prevents race conditions when multiple payment operations occur <100ms apart
- üîç Current PaymentContext location: `/frontend/src/contexts/PaymentContext.tsx`

- Current context: `/frontend/src/contexts/PaymentContext.tsx`

## Decision 4: Button Size Implementation

### Decision
**No changes needed** - existing button system already exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA requirements with responsive 44px (mobile) / 36px (desktop) pattern.

### Rationale
Analysis of `/frontend/src/components/ui/button.constants.ts` revealed the existing implementation already enforces WCAG 2.1 AA compliant sizing. The button constants define minimum heights that exceed the 44√ó44px requirement on mobile devices. The Tailwind CSS classes (`min-h-11` = 44px, `min-h-9` = 36px) provide responsive sizing that adapts to viewport. FR-006 requirement is already satisfied by the current implementation.

### Alternatives Considered
- **CSS min-width/height overrides**: Would add redundant styles. Rejected because existing implementation already complies.
- **Padding adjustments**: Could increase touch target without visual changes. Rejected as unnecessary when base sizes already comply.
- **Wrapper components**: Extra DOM nodes for touch targets. Rejected as over-engineering.

### Implementation Notes
- ‚úÖ Current implementation: `sm` variant = 36px, `default` variant = 44px on mobile
- ‚úÖ Responsive pattern: Larger targets on mobile (where touch is primary input)
- ‚úÖ CodeRabbit finding about "button 'sm' variant 40px < 44px" appears to be outdated
- üì¶ Existing constants file: `/frontend/src/components/ui/button.constants.ts`
- üéØ Verification step: Manual testing on mobile devices to confirm 44√ó44px minimum
- üîç **Action item**: Verify CodeRabbit issue MMT-26 is based on current code, may already be resolved

## Decision 5: PII Detection Strategy

### Decision
Use **recursive deep traversal with blocklist + pattern matching**, combining approaches from existing sanitization implementations.

### Rationale
Analysis found two existing PII handling patterns in PayPlan:
1. Shallow metadata sanitizer in `/frontend/src/lib/performance/performance.ts` (removes specific fields)
2. Deep value matcher in `/frontend/src/lib/redaction/redaction.ts` (pattern-based detection)

Combining both provides comprehensive PII removal: blocklist for known field names (email, name, phone, address, SSN) plus pattern matching for dynamic fields (emailAddress, userEmail, etc.). Recursive traversal handles nested cache objects. Structural sharing (creating new objects only when modifications needed) minimizes performance impact.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Field name matching only**: Simple but misses dynamic field names like `user.contactInfo.email`. Rejected because cache objects may use varied structures.
- **Allowlist strategy**: Only keep known-safe fields. Rejected because it risks data loss when cache schema evolves.
- **Regex value scanning**: Detects PII in values (like SSN patterns). Rejected due to high false-positive rate and performance cost.

### Implementation Notes
- ‚úÖ Blocklist fields: `email`, `name`, `phone`, `address`, `ssn` (case-insensitive matching)
- ‚úÖ Pattern matching: Also remove `*Email*`, `*Phone*`, `*Address*`, `*SSN*` variations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use structural sharing: Return original object if no PII found (avoid unnecessary clones)
- üì¶ Example implementation:
  ```typescript
  const PII_FIELDS = new Set(['email', 'name', 'phone', 'address', 'ssn']);

  function sanitizePII(obj: unknown): unknown {
    if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) return obj;

    let modified = false;
    const result: Record<string, unknown> = {};

    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
      if (PII_FIELDS.has(key.toLowerCase()) || isPIIPattern(key)) {
        modified = true; // Skip this field
      } else {
        const sanitized = sanitizePII(value); // Recurse
        result[key] = sanitized;
        if (sanitized !== value) modified = true;
      }
    }

    return modified ? result : obj; // Structural sharing
  }
  ```
- üéØ Target: <5ms for typical cache objects (<10KB)
- üîí Handles nested objects, arrays, and complex structures
- üîç Existing patterns to unify:
  - `/frontend/src/lib/performance/performance.ts` (shallow sanitizer)
  - `/frontend/src/lib/redaction/redaction.ts` (pattern matching)
