File: specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt
Line: 145 to 151
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt around lines 145 to 151, the section for frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx (lines 116–148) contains only a header and metadata with no review guidance; either populate this section with a concise review note specific to those test lines (e.g., describe the missing test assertions, mock setup issues, or improvements to make the tests deterministic and accessible) or remove the empty section entirely to keep the document consistent—ensure the added content clearly references the file and line range and gives actionable guidance, or if removing, delete the header and metadata so no empty placeholder remains.

Line: 153 to 159
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt around lines 153 to 159 the section referencing frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx contains a header and metadata but no prompt content; either add the missing review guidance specifically targeting lines 20–25 (e.g., describe expected behavior, any accessibility/props/tests to check, and suggested fixes) or remove this incomplete section entirely so the file has no empty placeholders.



============================================================================
File: specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt
Line: 68 to 75
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt around lines 68 to 75, the section header for scripts/measure-performance.sh is present but contains no prompt content; either add the missing AI review guidance or remove the empty section. To fix, populate this section with a concise prompt for the agent that states the problem observed in scripts/measure-performance.sh, expected behavior, reproduction steps, and a suggested remediation (or test) so the reviewer can act, or delete the header entirely if no review is required.



============================================================================
File: specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt
Line: 87 to 93
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/coderabbit-review.txt around lines 87 to 93 (corresponding to frontend/src/App.tsx lines 104–139), there is an empty prompt placeholder under the section header/metadata; either populate it with the specific refactoring guidance for the App.tsx code in that range (describe the issue, exact changes to make, and any tests/behaviour expectations) or remove the empty section entirely; ensure the file retains correct headers/metadata, that the inserted prompt explicitly references the App.tsx lines and desired refactor, and commit the change with a clear message.



============================================================================
File: frontend/vite.config.ts
Line: 22 to 55
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
frontend/vite.config.ts around lines 22-55: the manualChunks logic uses fragile path includes and aggressive splitting which can hurt caching, maintainability, and predictability for critical payment code; simplify and harden the strategy by (1) consolidating vendor output to fewer chunks (e.g., a single vendor or a small set) to improve cache stability, (2) move any payment/BNPL-related libraries into a deterministic chunk (or bundle them with the main app) so they always load predictably, (3) replace brittle path-based checks with a maintained list of packages or a regex-based matcher and document each vendor group with why it exists, and (4) add build-time monitoring/CI checks to record chunk names and sizes so you can validate the strategy and add cache-busting headers or filename hashing in deployment as needed.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/NavigationHeader.test.tsx
Line: 314 to 327
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/NavigationHeader.test.tsx around lines 314 to 327, the accessibility tests miss exercising the mobile menu/dialog state; add a test that simulates opening the mobile menu (use userEvent to click the menu button via its accessible name), then run axe against the rendered container and assert no violations, ensuring the mobile dialog is mounted and focus/ARIA behavior is analyzed.



============================================================================
File: scripts/measure-performance.sh
Line: 49 to 59
Type: nitpick




============================================================================
File: scripts/measure-performance.sh
Line: 24 to 27
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/measure-performance.sh around lines 24 to 27 the BASELINE_FILE and RESULTS_DIR are hardcoded to specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/, which ties the script to Feature 018; make these paths configurable by introducing a FEATURE_ID or BASE_DIR variable (read from an environment variable with a sensible default) and build BASELINE_FILE and RESULTS_DIR from that variable, e.g. FEATURE_ID="${FEATURE_ID:-018-technical-debt-cleanup}" or BASE_DIR="${BASE_DIR:-specs/$FEATURE_ID}", then set BASELINE_FILE and RESULTS_DIR using those variables and keep the mkdir -p "$RESULTS_DIR" call; update any other references in the script to use the new variables.



============================================================================
File: scripts/measure-performance.sh
Line: 37 to 41
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/measure-performance.sh around lines 37 to 41, the current command silences all build output which hides why npm run build failed; capture stdout+stderr into a temporary log file (or a results subdirectory file), run npm run build redirecting output to that file, and on failure print a concise diagnostic (e.g., the last N lines from the log) to stderr and point to the full log file for full context; on success remove or archive the temporary log and exit with the npm build exit code so callers see the correct status.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 17
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around line 17 (and also apply the same validation for the usage at lines 32-36), DEV_SERVER_PORT is not validated before being passed to curl; add a numeric and range check (1-65535) immediately after the existing default assignment, and if invalid print a clear error to stderr and exit 1; also ensure curl is installed before calling it and surface an explicit error if the dev server is not reachable on the validated port, then proceed to the existing curl call only when validation and availability checks pass.



============================================================================
File: scripts/measure-performance.sh
Line: 66 to 68
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/measure-performance.sh around lines 66 to 68, the RESULTS_FILE timestamp uses second precision which can collide if the script runs multiple times within a second; update the timestamp generation to include millisecond precision (e.g., use date with millisecond formatting like %3N or %N truncated to 3 digits, keeping UTC if desired) so the RESULTS_FILE variable includes milliseconds and prevents filename collisions.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 23
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around line 23, the OUTPUT_FILE is set directly from $1 which allows directory traversal or absolute paths; add validation immediately after assigning OUTPUT_FILE to reject absolute paths and any occurrences of ".." or segments like "/." (hidden/parent traversal), and exit with a clear error if validation fails so only safe relative paths under the repo are accepted.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 48 to 50
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around lines 48 to 50, the report metadata prints the timestamp without indicating its timezone; update the here-doc that writes the report header so the Date line appends " (UTC)" (e.g. Date: $TIMESTAMP (UTC)), and ensure the heredoc content includes that change along with existing tool, standard, and pages-tested lines so reviewers know the timestamp is UTC.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 18 to 24
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around lines 18 to 24, the AUDIT_PAGES_CSV parsing can introduce unsafe or malformed page names that may break the generated markdown; validate and sanitize each entry after splitting: ensure you read the CSV into an array using quoted expansion, iterate over AUDIT_PAGES and reject or normalize any value that doesn't match an expected path pattern (e.g., ^/[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]*$) by printing an error and exiting, and/or escape markdown-special characters before writing to the report (also apply escaping where pages are interpolated at lines ~60 and ~89); avoid silent acceptance of invalid entries so the audit output cannot be corrupted.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 14
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around lines 14 and 42, add a failure trap and a write-permission check: register a trap on ERR that echoes the failing line number to stderr to give context when the script exits, and after creating the output directory validate that the script can actually write to the report path by attempting to create the directory and a temp test file (touch) for OUTPUT_FILE, fail with a descriptive error and non-zero exit if that test cannot write, and remove the test file afterwards to clean up.



============================================================================
File: scripts/accessibility-audit.sh
Line: 87 to 110
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
scripts/accessibility-audit.sh around lines 87-110: the script injects raw page names into the generated markdown and uses them directly in the URL, which can break formatting or produce unsafe paths; escape markdown special characters in the page name before writing it to the report (e.g., backticks, brackets, hashes, asterisks, underscores, etc.) and use the escaped value in the "Page:" heading, and sanitize/URL-encode the page path used in the URL (or at minimum validate/normalize it to ensure it begins with a single slash and contains no CR/LF or dangerous characters) so the generated URL is safe; update the loop to compute an escaped_page variable for markdown and a safe_page variable for the URL and use those variables in the heredoc.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/App.tsx
Line: 150 to 152
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/App.tsx around lines 150 to 152, the catch block currently swallows errors; update it to log the caught error only in development: inside the catch(err) branch, detect development via process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' (or your app's dev flag) and call console.debug or console.warn with a short contextual message and the error object; keep it silent in production to avoid noisy logs.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx
Line: 379 to 431
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx around lines 379 to 431, expand the test suite to cover more specific error scenarios: add tests that mock usePaymentArchives to return network errors (e.g., fetch/network failure) and authorization errors (e.g., 401/403) and assert the UI shows appropriate non-sensitive messages (e.g., "Network error" or "Unauthorized") and no PII/payment data; add tests that simulate getArchiveById returning 404 vs internal 500 and assert the breadcrumb falls back to the generic "Archive" label while displaying distinct, non-sensitive error cues for 404 vs 500; ensure mocks do not expose any sensitive fields and verify that nothing sensitive is rendered or logged by asserting absence of archive data in the DOM and by spying/mocking any logger calls to confirm only non-PII messages are produced.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx
Line: 157 to 159
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx around lines 157-159 and 316-318, the test currently detects the Radix Tooltip by querying for an internal data-state attribute (brittle); change the checks to assert tooltip behavior or a stable test hook: locate the tooltip trigger via an accessible selector (e.g., text, role, or aria-label) instead of '[data-state]', then either simulate hover/focus with userEvent (await user.hover/focus(trigger)) and assert the tooltip appears via screen.getByRole('tooltip'), or add a stable data-testid to the Tooltip component (e.g., 'breadcrumb-tooltip') and assert screen.getByTestId('breadcrumb-tooltip') is present; ensure awaits where necessary and remove reliance on internal Radix attributes.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx
Line: 279 to 319
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx around lines 279-319: this test duplicates coverage of the earlier test at lines 122-160 (both verify truncated long names and Radix Tooltip via data-state); either remove this duplicate test or change it to exercise a distinct scenario — for example, assert truncation behavior at a different maxLabelLength, test tooltip interaction (simulate hover/focus and assert tooltip content), or verify non-truncated behavior for shorter names — and update the test title and mocked data accordingly so each test covers a unique case.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx
Line: 21 to 26
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx around lines 21 to 26, the truncateLabel function fails for very small maxLength values (e.g. maxLength < 4) producing a result longer than requested; update it so that if maxLength <= 0 it returns an empty string, if maxLength <= 3 it returns '.' repeated maxLength, and otherwise returns the first (maxLength - 3) characters followed by '...' so the total length never exceeds maxLength.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx
Line: 57 to 106
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx around lines 57 to 106, the useMemo computes breadcrumb labels using isLoading and error (lines ~77-80) but those values are not listed in the dependency array, causing stale breadcrumbs; update the dependency array to include isLoading and error (in addition to location.pathname, validatedId, getArchiveById) so the memo recalculates when loading or error state changes.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx
Line: 39
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx around line 39, the archiveIdSchema currently uses z.string().min(1) which is too permissive for financial archive IDs; replace it with a UUID validator (e.g. use z.string().uuid()) so the schema enforces proper UUID format, update any related tests/types if necessary, and run/typecheck to ensure consumers still compile.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx
Line: 252 to 261
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.test.tsx around lines 252 to 261 there is a duplicate test that repeats the assertion already covered at lines 162-171; remove this duplicate test or replace it with a distinct scenario (e.g., render a different initialEntries path or verify a different breadcrumb item/state) so the suite no longer contains identical tests and the new test asserts a unique behavior.



============================================================================
File: frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx
Line: 157 to 176
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/src/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx around lines 157 to 176, the current truncated breadcrumb uses a  with cursor-default which is semantically incorrect for non-interactive content; replace the button with a non-interactive element by using a  with tabIndex={0} (or role="text" if preferred) and preserve existing classes, aria-current="page", and Tooltip.Trigger asChild behavior so keyboard focus and Tooltip still work; ensure you remove type="button" and border-0 specific button attributes and keep accessibility by allowing focus via tabIndex and keeping the Tooltip markup unchanged.
