Keep each entry to 2–3 sentences: one hypothesis, one-line acceptance criteria, and one owner, so developers can pick up work immediately.

CODERABBIT_ISSUE_MAPPING.md.bak around lines 46-49: the CSV export shows negative amounts with no specified business rules; define explicit negative-amount semantics in spec.md under "Data Validation" and enforce them in csvExport.ts (lines ~47-49). Update the spec to enumerate allowed cases (refund/reversal, chargeback, data-entry error) with expected handling for each (accept and mark as refund with reference IDs; accept as chargeback with separate code; or reject/flag invalid data), add example rows, and state required downstream mappings (accounting entries, balances). Then modify csvExport.ts to validate amounts against the new spec: detect negatives, apply the correct classification or emit a validation error/log according to the rule, add unit tests for each case, and update changelog/docs to reflect the new validation behavior.

Please try again or contact support.') and extend the sanitizer to accept an optional context parameter or enum to select between messages while still never exposing internal error details. Implement a simple switch or mapping that returns GENERIC_PAYMENT_MESSAGE when context === 'payment' (defaulting to GENERIC_CLIENT_MESSAGE otherwise), keep FR-002 compliance by never including raw error info, and update payment flow callers to pass the 'payment' context when sanitizing errors.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In backend/src/lib/security/ErrorSanitizer.js around line 68, the additionalData property is passed through unsanitized and may contain PII/payment data; replace this with a sanitized/filtered object: implement an allowlist of safe keys (e.g., minimal domain-specific metadata) and drop or redact any keys not on the allowlist, and explicitly redact known sensitive keys (cardNumber, cardCVV, cvv, ssn, socialSecurityNumber, bankAccount, routingNumber, accountNumber, paymentToken, fullName, dob, address, email if required) by replacing values with a standard placeholder like "[REDACTED]"; if a nested object is present, apply the same allowlist/redaction recursively. Also add a brief JSDoc comment above the sanitizer describing that callers must not include raw payment or PII in additionalData and listing prohibited fields, so behavior is documented even if callers forget to comply.

ErrorContextSchema.parse(context) : undefined) then use validatedContext throughout the rest of the method instead of the raw context; ensure typings reflect the parsed schema and handle parse errors appropriately (let them throw or catch and convert to SanitizedError as needed).

Specifically, add a test that constructs an entry with a large result payload (e.g. ~1MB string or nested object) and asserts whether IdempotencyCacheEntrySchema.safeParse either accepts it or fails according to our chosen policy — if we decide to cap size, update the schema to validate a max serialized size and assert the failure; if we accept it, assert success. Also add a test that simulates logging (or calls the logger wrapper used in code) and asserts the logged output does not contain the raw result field (masking/omitting it), and if needed implement masking/omission in the logger or storage path. Ensure tests cover both size and PII masking behaviour and update schema/logger accordingly.
