# Specification Quality Checklist: Technical Debt Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Details

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on WHAT users need and WHY, avoiding HOW to implement. No mention of specific frameworks, languages, or implementation approaches.

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 19 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- All 5 non-functional requirements are clear
- 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- All 4 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions are well-documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover all priority levels (P0-P3)
- Success criteria are measurable (zero occurrences, 100% pass rates, specific percentages)
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

This specification is ready to proceed to either `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` without requiring any updates. The feature addresses a well-defined set of 44 issues from CodeRabbit review with clear priorities, testable requirements, and measurable success criteria.
