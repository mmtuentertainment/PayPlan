# Baseline Performance Metrics

**Feature**: 018-technical-debt-cleanup
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Purpose**: Track performance metrics before and after implementation

## Initial Baseline (Before Implementation)

**Measurement Date**: 2025-10-23 12:51 UTC

### Build Metrics
- **Build Time**: 45.00s (45000ms)
- **Bundle Size**: 4.20MB (4,404,019 bytes)
- **Test Count**: 1387 tests (confirmed from spec)

**Structured Baseline**: See [BASELINE_METRICS.json](BASELINE_METRICS.json) for machine-readable version consumed by measure-performance.sh

### Quality Gates (NFR-004)
- **Build Time Threshold**: ≤110% of baseline (max +10%)
- **Bundle Size Threshold**: ≤105% of baseline (max +5%)

### Test Coverage
- **Existing Tests**: 1387 tests passing
- **Target Tests**: 1429 tests (1387 existing + 42 new)
- **Required Pass Rate**: 100%

## Success Criteria Tracking

### Security (P0)
- [ ] SC-001: Production console contains zero payment-related log entries
- [ ] SC-002: API error responses contain zero internal implementation details
- [ ] SC-003: System processes malformed cache data without crashes (100% resilience)
- [ ] SC-004: Duplicate payment attempts within 24 hours are prevented (0% duplication rate)

### Type Safety & WCAG (P1)
- [ ] SC-005: All interactive buttons meet or exceed 44×44 pixel minimum on mobile devices (100% WCAG compliance)
- [ ] SC-006: System rejects 100% of malformed payment requests before processing
- [ ] SC-007: Financial calculations produce zero invalid numeric results (0% NaN occurrences)

### Overall Quality
- [ ] SC-008: All 1387 existing tests continue passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- [ ] SC-009: Zero P0 security issues remain after implementation
- [ ] SC-010: Zero P1 type safety issues remain after implementation

## Measurement History

Results are stored in `specs/018-technical-debt-cleanup/performance-results/`

### After Phase 1 Implementation (2025-10-23 20:04 UTC)

**File**: [BASELINE_METRICS.json](BASELINE_METRICS.json) (current working baseline)

### Post-Optimization Metrics
- **Build Time**: 18.50s (18500ms) ✅ **59% improvement** from 45.00s
- **Bundle Size**: 2.16MB (2,267,527 bytes) ✅ **49% improvement** from 4.20MB
- **Test Count**: 1416 tests ✅ **+29 tests** from 1387

**Optimizations Applied**:
1. Lazy loading for Docs, Privacy, Demo pages (reduced main bundle)
2. Vendor chunking strategy (React, UI, large libs in separate chunks)
3. Error boundary with rate limiting
4. Performance monitoring utilities

**Quality Gates**: ✅ Both thresholds met
- Build Time: -59% (well under +10% threshold)
- Bundle Size: -49% (well under +5% threshold)
