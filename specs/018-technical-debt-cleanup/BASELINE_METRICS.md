# Baseline Performance Metrics

**Feature**: 018-technical-debt-cleanup
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Purpose**: Track performance metrics before and after implementation

## Initial Baseline (Before Implementation)

**Measurement Date**: 2025-10-23 12:51 UTC

### Build Metrics
- **Build Time**: 45.00s (45000ms)
- **Bundle Size**: 4.20MB (4,404,019 bytes)
- **Test Count**: 1387 tests (confirmed from spec)

**Structured Baseline**: See [BASELINE_METRICS.json](BASELINE_METRICS.json) for machine-readable version consumed by measure-performance.sh

### Quality Gates (NFR-004)
- **Build Time Threshold**: ≤110% of baseline (max +10%)
- **Bundle Size Threshold**: ≤105% of baseline (max +5%)

### Test Coverage
- **Existing Tests**: 1387 tests passing
- **Target Tests**: 1429 tests (1387 existing + 42 new)
- **Required Pass Rate**: 100%

## Success Criteria Tracking

### Security (P0)
- [ ] SC-001: Production console contains zero payment-related log entries
- [ ] SC-002: API error responses contain zero internal implementation details
- [ ] SC-003: System processes malformed cache data without crashes (100% resilience)
- [ ] SC-004: Duplicate payment attempts within 24 hours are prevented (0% duplication rate)

### Type Safety & WCAG (P1)
- [ ] SC-005: All interactive buttons meet or exceed 44×44 pixel minimum on mobile devices (100% WCAG compliance)
- [ ] SC-006: System rejects 100% of malformed payment requests before processing
- [ ] SC-007: Financial calculations produce zero invalid numeric results (0% NaN occurrences)

### Overall Quality
- [ ] SC-008: All 1387 existing tests continue passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- [ ] SC-009: Zero P0 security issues remain after implementation
- [ ] SC-010: Zero P1 type safety issues remain after implementation
