# Performance Baseline Reference Output
#
# PURPOSE: This file captures the raw output from the initial performance measurement
# script run (measure-performance.sh) before Feature 018 implementation begins.
# It serves as a reference for comparing build time and bundle size changes.
#
# SECTIONS:
# - Build time measurement (in seconds/milliseconds)
# - Bundle size calculation (in MB/bytes)
# - Test count summary
#
# CONSUMPTION: This file is referenced manually during performance validation (Phase 6).
# The measure-performance.sh script compares current metrics against BASELINE_METRICS.md,
# not this file. This is historical output only for debugging.
#
# MAINTENANCE:
# - Owner: Feature 018 implementation team
# - Update: Only regenerate if baseline changes (e.g., before feature work starts)
# - Review: Check that metrics match BASELINE_METRICS.md expectations
#
# TOLERANCES (NFR-004):
# - Build time: ‚â§110% of baseline (max +10%)
# - Bundle size: ‚â§105% of baseline (max +5%)
