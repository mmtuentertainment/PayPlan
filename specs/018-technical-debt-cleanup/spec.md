## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- Q: What are the maximum acceptable increases for build time and bundle size (NFR-004)? → A: 10% build time, 5% bundle size
- Q: Which specific fields should be considered PII and removed from cache entries (FR-013)? → A: Email, name, phone, address, SSN
- Q: What should the maximum allowed JSON nesting depth be (FR-012)? → A: 10 levels maximum
- Q: What should the standard generic error message format be for API errors (FR-002)? → A: "An error occurred. Please try again."
- Q: How should the system handle negative payment amounts? → A: Validate as refund with negative sign

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Critical Security & Business Logic Fixes (Priority: P0)

Users need the system to protect their payment information and prevent duplicate transactions. Currently, users are at risk because:
- Payment validation errors expose sensitive details in browser console
- API errors reveal internal system details to potential attackers
- Malformed data can crash payment processing
- System allows duplicate payments after 60 seconds

**Why this priority**: These are critical security and business logic issues that directly impact payment safety, user privacy, and system reliability. Must be fixed before production deployment to prevent data breaches and financial errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting validation errors in production build, sending malformed cache data, retrying payments, and verifying error messages contain no sensitive information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** production build deployed, **When** validation error occurs, **Then** no payment details appear in browser console (dev builds still log for debugging)
2. **Given** API internal error occurs, **When** error returned to client, **Then** generic message shown to user, full error logged server-side only
3. **Given** malformed cache data exists, **When** idempotency check runs, **Then** treats as cache miss without crashing
4. **Given** cache check fails, **When** payment operation attempted, **Then** operation aborts with error instead of proceeding
5. **Given** payment retry after 30 minutes, **When** idempotency check runs, **Then** detects duplicate and prevents retry

### User Story 2 - Type Safety & WCAG Compliance (Priority: P1)

Users with disabilities need accessible interfaces, and all users need reliable financial calculations. Currently:
- Touch targets are too small on mobile (below WCAG minimum)
- System accepts invalid payment data that corrupts schedules
- Financial calculations can receive invalid numeric data
- UI components bypass validation checks

**Why this priority**: Type safety prevents financial calculation errors that cost users money. WCAG compliance is legally required for accessibility and ensures all users can interact with payment controls reliably.

**Independent Test**: Test button sizes on mobile devices, submit malformed payment data, attempt calculations with invalid numbers, and verify assistive technology compatibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** button with small variant on mobile, **When** user taps it, **Then** touch target meets 44×44px WCAG minimum
2. **Given** malformed API request body, **When** validation runs, **Then** returns clear error messages before processing
3. **Given** invalid amount string, **When** numeric parsing runs, **Then** detects invalid data and provides clear error
4. **Given** invalid input value, **When** UI event handler fires, **Then** validation prevents invalid state
5. **Given** browser without certain APIs, **When** system checks browser capabilities, **Then** handles gracefully without errors

---

### User Story 3 - Architecture & Runtime Validation (Priority: P2)

The system needs robust defenses against malicious inputs and edge cases. Currently:
- Cache layer lacks validation for stored data
- Unbounded JSON nesting allows denial-of-service attacks
- Personally identifiable information may be cached unnecessarily
- Date/time validation varies by timezone
- Concurrent updates can corrupt payment data

**Why this priority**: These architectural improvements prevent future bugs, improve maintainability, and strengthen security. Not blocking current functionality but critical for long-term quality and security posture.

**Independent Test**: Submit deeply nested JSON payloads, test concurrent payment updates, verify PII is not cached, and test date validation across timezones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** deeply nested JSON payload exceeds 10 levels, **When** validation runs, **Then** rejects with clear error message
2. **Given** cache entry with personal information fields, **When** sanitization runs, **Then** removes sensitive data before storing
3. **Given** malformed payment item data, **When** validation runs, **Then** returns descriptive errors
4. **Given** concurrent payment updates, **When** multiple operations occur simultaneously, **Then** all updates apply correctly without data loss
5. **Given** negative payment amount, **When** validation runs, **Then** validates as refund with negative sign preserved

---

### User Story 4 - Code Quality & Documentation (Priority: P3)

Developers need maintainable code that works across different environments. Currently:
- Code has redundant styling
- Scripts are tied to specific machine configurations
- Date sorting uses unreliable text comparison
- Code suppressions lack explanations

**Why this priority**: Code quality improvements don't impact functionality immediately but improve developer experience, reduce future bugs, and make the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

**Independent Test**: Run scripts on different machines, verify date sorting accuracy, and confirm linting rules are properly documented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** component with styling, **When** rendered, **Then** no redundant inline styles duplicate existing classes
2. **Given** script run on different developer machine, **When** executed, **Then** works without path modifications
3. **Given** dates need sorting, **When** sort function runs, **Then** uses reliable timestamp comparison
4. **Given** linting suppression in code, **When** reviewed, **Then** has clear explanation of why suppression is needed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when CodeRabbit identifies additional issues during implementation? Document in tracking system for future cleanup sprint
- How do we prevent regressions after fixes? Each fix must include automated tests proving issue is resolved
- What if fixes break existing functionality? All 1387 existing tests must continue passing at 100%
- How do we prioritize if time is limited? P0 fixes are mandatory, P1-P3 can be deferred to future sprints
- What if a fix has performance impact? Monitor build time and bundle size - no regressions allowed
