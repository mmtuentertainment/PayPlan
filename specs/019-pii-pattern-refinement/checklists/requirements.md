## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review

**No implementation details**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on word boundary matching, pattern detection, and sanitization behavior without mentioning specific regex implementations, JavaScript syntax, or code structure
- Uses technology-agnostic language like "System MUST implement word boundary pattern matching" rather than "System MUST use /\bpattern\b/ regex"

**Focused on user value and business needs**: ✅ PASS
- Clearly articulates developer pain points (debugging blocked by false positives)
- Emphasizes security risks (authentication secrets leaking in logs)
- All user stories explain "Why this priority" with business/security justification

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✅ PASS
- User scenarios describe developer workflows in plain language
- Success criteria focus on observable outcomes (zero false positives, zero complaints)
- Technical terms (camelCase, snake_case) are used only where necessary for precision

**All mandatory sections completed**: ✅ PASS
- User Scenarios & Testing: 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- Requirements: 12 functional requirements, 3 key entities
- Success Criteria: 8 measurable outcomes
- Additional sections: Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope

### Requirement Completeness Review

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**: ✅ PASS
- Zero clarification markers in the specification
- All requirements are concrete and specific

**Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: ✅ PASS
- FR-001 through FR-012 each describe specific, verifiable behavior
- Examples: "fields like `filename`, `accountId` must NOT be sanitized" (FR-009), "fields like `password`, `token` must BE sanitized" (FR-010)
- Each requirement has clear pass/fail criteria

**Success criteria are measurable**: ✅ PASS
- SC-001: Zero false positives (100% of specific fields preserved)
- SC-002: Zero false negatives (100% of specific fields sanitized)
- SC-003: All 226+ tests pass
- SC-004: Performance under 50ms
- SC-007: Test coverage increases to 240-250 tests
- SC-008: 90% of developers can predict behavior

**Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ PASS
- No mention of specific implementations (regex engines, JavaScript, Node.js)
- Focuses on observable behavior and outcomes
- Example: "Sanitization performance remains under 50ms" rather than "Regex execution completes in under 50ms"

**All acceptance scenarios are defined**: ✅ PASS
- User Story 1: 5 scenarios covering false positives and correct detection
- User Story 2: 6 scenarios covering authentication secrets
- User Story 3: 6 scenarios covering scoped IP address detection
- User Story 4: 6 scenarios covering backward compatibility
- Total: 23 concrete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format

**Edge cases are identified**: ✅ PASS
- 6 edge cases documented with expected behavior:
  - Multiple patterns in one field
  - camelCase vs snake_case boundaries
  - Compound fields with mixed terms
  - Performance with large objects
  - Future authentication patterns
  - Case variations

**Scope is clearly bounded**: ✅ PASS
- 8 explicit "Out of Scope" items clearly define what is NOT included
- Examples: No ML/AI detection, no internationalization, no user customization, no value-based detection

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✅ PASS
- 7 assumptions documented with clear reasoning
- 3 dependencies identified (Feature 018, existing test suite, Linear issue)
- Each assumption explains the rationale (e.g., Assumption 3 explains why auth secrets are higher priority)

### Feature Readiness Review

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
- Each FR-001 through FR-012 maps directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- FR-009 (false positives) → User Story 1 scenarios 1-3
- FR-010 (false negatives) → User Story 2 scenarios 1-6
- FR-007 (backward compatibility) → User Story 4 scenarios 5-6

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
- P1 Story 1: Developer debugging (false positive prevention)
- P1 Story 2: Security secret detection (false negative prevention)
- P2 Story 3: Scoped IP detection (developer experience)
- P2 Story 4: Backward compatibility (risk mitigation)
- All critical flows covered with appropriate priorities

**Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria**: ✅ PASS
- Each success criterion has specific, measurable targets
- Traceability: SC-001 → User Story 1, SC-002 → User Story 2, SC-003 → User Story 4
- Business value clearly articulated: improved debugging (SC-005), improved security (SC-006)

**No implementation details leak into specification**: ✅ PASS
- Specification describes behavior and requirements without prescribing implementation
- Examples like `/(^|_)pattern(_|$)/` appear only in Assumptions section as hypothetical approaches, not as required implementation
- Functional requirements focus on "what" not "how" (e.g., FR-001: "implement word boundary pattern matching" not "use regex \b metacharacter")

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, clear, testable, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage prevents ambiguity during implementation
- Clear prioritization with strong business justification for P1 stories
- Excellent backward compatibility focus (226+ tests must pass)
- Measurable success criteria enable objective validation

**No issues requiring resolution**
