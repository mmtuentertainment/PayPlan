## 💡 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE

### The Winning Solution: Inline Styles

**Why it worked:**
1. **No Tailwind purging** - Colors are hardcoded in JavaScript
2. **No build-time magic** - Styles are guaranteed to appear
3. **Exact colors** - Hex codes directly in component
4. **Simple to debug** - No CSS compilation issues

**The key insight:**
- Tailwind purges dynamic class names at build time
- Inline styles bypass this entirely
- Guaranteed to work in production
