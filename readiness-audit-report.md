# PayPlan Project Readiness Audit

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit was conducted to ensure the `PayPlan` repository is fully prepared for a fresh start on the next feature specification. The audit reveals that while the project has a strong constitutional and workflow foundation, **two critical blockers** currently prevent the development workflow from functioning correctly.

**Overall Readiness: üî¥ NOT READY**

Once the critical recommendations are implemented, the project will be in an excellent state to proceed.

## 2. Audit Checklist & Findings

| Category | Item | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Repo & Git** | `main` branch is clean | ‚úÖ **Ready** | Working tree is clean, and `main` is up to date. |
| | Stale remote branches | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** | Numerous old feature branches exist. Harmless but clutters the repo. |
| **Spec-Kit** | Command templates exist | ‚úÖ **Ready** | All `speckit.*.md` commands are present in `.claude/commands/`. |
| | Script paths in templates | üî¥ **BLOCKER** | `speckit.specify.md` points to a non-existent script path: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`. |
| | Template paths in scripts | üî¥ **BLOCKER** | `create-new-feature.sh` points to a non-existent template: `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`. |
| **Constitution** | `constitution.md` is complete | ‚úÖ **Ready** | The constitution is comprehensive and aligned with project goals. |
| | `CLAUDE.md` is complete | ‚úÖ **Ready** | The workflow documentation for the AI developer is clear and detailed. |
| **Environment** | Dependencies are listed | ‚úÖ **Ready** | `package.json` and `frontend/package.json` exist. |
| | Dependencies are installed | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** | The constitutionally **mandated `recharts` library is NOT installed** in the frontend. |
| **Specs** | Next feature spec exists | ‚úÖ **Ready** | `specs/061-spending-categories-budgets/spec.md` is in `Draft` state, ready for work. |
| | Old specs are archived | ‚úÖ **Ready** | Old specs are present, providing historical context without blocking new work. |
| **CI/CD & Bots** | CodeRabbit config exists | ‚úÖ **Ready** | `.coderabbit.yaml` is well-configured to enforce the constitution. |
| | GitHub Actions exist | ‚úÖ **Ready** | Workflows for CI and bot reviews are in place. |

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

To achieve full readiness, the following actions must be taken.

### CRITICAL: Must-Fix Blockers

**1. Fix Incorrect Spec-Kit Paths (BLOCKER)**
   - **Problem**: The `speckit.specify` command will fail because it calls a script at a wrong location, and that script in turn calls for a template at another wrong location.
   - **Action**: Correct the paths in two files:
     - **File 1**: `.claude/commands/speckit.specify.md`
       - **Find**: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`
       - **Replace with**: `scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`
     - **File 2**: `scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`
       - **Find**: `$REPO_ROOT/.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
       - **Replace with**: `$REPO_ROOT/templates/spec-template.md` (We will create this directory next).

**2. Install Missing `recharts` Dependency (BLOCKER)**
   - **Problem**: The frontend will fail to build or run any feature involving charts, as the mandated `recharts` library is missing.
   - **Action**: Run the following command in the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     npm install recharts
     ```

### RECOMMENDED: Housekeeping

**3. Create Missing `templates` Directory and `spec-template.md`**
   - **Problem**: The `create-new-feature.sh` script expects a template file at `templates/spec-template.md`, but the directory and file are missing.
   - **Action**: Create the directory and a basic placeholder file.
     ```bash
     mkdir -p templates
     touch templates/spec-template.md
     ```

**4. Clean Up Stale Git Branches**
   - **Problem**: The repository has many old, merged remote branches, which can cause confusion.
   - **Action (Optional)**: Prune these branches. This is good hygiene but not a blocker for starting work.

## 4. Final Readiness Assessment

- **Current Score**: üî¥ **30% - NOT READY**. The workflow is critically broken due to incorrect paths and missing dependencies.
- **Score After Fixes**: ‚úÖ **95% - READY**. After implementing the critical recommendations, the environment will be fully prepared for a smooth and efficient start.
