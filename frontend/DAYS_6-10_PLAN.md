## Risks & Considerations

**Known Challenges**:
1. Some issues may be harder than estimated
2. May discover new issues while fixing others
3. Testing changes may break existing tests
4. Performance optimization requires careful benchmarking

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on high-impact issues first
- Keep changes small and testable
- Run full test suite after each day
- Document any new issues discovered
