# PR Notes: Test Suites Green (Backend + Frontend)

## Summary
- Backend (Jest): 84/84 tests passed.
- Frontend (Vitest): 1308/1308 tests passed.

## Backend Changes
- tests/unit/ics-generator.test.js:22
  - Unfold ICS content before assertions to account for RFC5545 line folding.
- tests/integration/business-days.test.js:61
  - Unfold ICS content before checking "Originally due:" line.

Rationale: ICS generator folds long lines; tests now assert on unfolded content while still verifying that folding occurs.

## Frontend Changes (email extractor)
- File: frontend/src/lib/email-extractor.ts
  - Added resilient generic fallback for unknown/malformed inputs (amount/date/installment/provider inference).
  - Imported `parseDate` to enable fallback date parsing.
  - Early handling for whitespace-only and special-character-only inputs: return a single friendly issue.
  - Conditional max-length policy:
    - Absolute cap: 120,000 chars (throw).
    - 16,000 char cap only for inputs without meaningful signals.
  - Preserve `---` delimiters in normalization so multi-email inputs split correctly.
  - Non-meaningful blocks now emit a clear issue; mixed inputs cache issues as expected.

## Test Outcomes
- Fixed 18 prior failures in `tests/unit/security-injection.test.ts` (injections, unicode, CRLF, very large inputs) â€” now pass.
- Fixed `tests/integration/cache-integration.test.ts` expectation by preserving `---` during normalization; result contains one item and one issue.

## Considerations
- Behavior changes are limited to extraction robustness and user-facing error messages for pathological inputs.
- ICS generator logic unchanged; tests updated to reflect folding rules.

## How to Verify Locally
- Backend: `npx jest --runInBand`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm test`

## Risks
- The generic fallback may extract minimal data from atypical inputs; confidence scoring is conservative.
